"""Native candidate-scoring fast path for the typed decision plane (TD-1b/1c).

``run_typed_decisions_native`` answers a whole ``Question`` catalogue in ONE
grammar-constrained ``LLMPrimitives.llm_call``. In TD-1b it generated exactly
one token per question, in catalogue order, under a GBNF grammar whose
position ``i`` only accepted question ``i``'s candidate TOKEN IDS. TD-1c
changes the generation layout because the live measurement showed that bare
concatenation is NOT semantically equivalent to JSON mode (agreement 11/16,
native accuracy 68.8% vs JSON 91.7% on the same 16 questions, a false-bias
on noul positions):

TD-1c — why the answer cue is REPLAYED, not merely listed:
    A single completion has exactly one "next token" position, so a prompt
    that merely lists N questions with N answer cues cannot condition answer
    ``i`` on cue ``i`` — the model sees every cue before it emits anything.
    The live failure was exactly that: at position 1 (no prior emission) the
    model answered the first noul correctly, and positions 2..8 collapsed to
    ``false`` even when the JSON arm answered ``true``. TD-1c makes the
    decoder re-emit each question's cue as fixed token ids BETWEEN the answer
    slots::

        <cue 1 tokens> <answer 1 token> <cue 2 tokens> <answer 2 token> ...

    so every answer token is generated immediately after its own question's
    cue (question id + question text + ``Answer (one of: ...):``), which is
    the conditioning the JSON arm gets from writing one answer object per
    question. The cue tokens are obtained from the SAME tokenization seam the
    candidates use (``POST /tokenize`` by default) and are compiled into the
    grammar as exact-token terminals, so the layout is deterministic and the
    "one constrained token per question" readout is preserved.

TD-1d — cue styles (speed at parity):
    The TD-1c replay restored conditioning at the cost of ~300+ grammar-forced
    cue tokens for a 24-question catalogue (523 generated tokens, 2.08x vs
    JSON). ``CueStyle`` selects how much of that cue is replayed: ``FULL`` is
    the TD-1c layout and remains the default; ``SHORT`` replays
    ``Q <id>: <first six words>``; ``ID_ONLY`` replays ``<id>: `` alone. The
    numbered catalogue rendered by ``build_native_prompt`` is byte-identical
    across styles — the prompt carries the grounding, the cue only re-conditions
    the answer position — so a sweep varies exactly one thing: which cue tokens
    are replayed. The tokenizer bind, the exact-token grammar terminals, the
    probability slicing and every fail-closed contract are unchanged.

Probability semantics (investigated 2026-09-17 against the frozen v9 tree):
    ``post_sampling_probs=false`` (the default; ``src/backends/llama_server.py``
    does not set it) captures the PRE-sampler distribution:
    ``server-context.cpp`` sets ``need_pre_sample_logits = n_probs > 0 &&
    !post_sampling_probs`` and therefore disables backend sampling, so
    ``get_token_probabilities`` (``server-common.cpp``) softmaxes the raw
    full-vocab logits from ``llama_get_logits_ith``. The GBNF grammar mask is
    applied in the CPU sampler chain to a COPY, so ``top_logprobs`` never
    reflect it. Consequences: (a) the slice is raw model mass, and mass that
    landed outside the declared candidates is invisible in the runner's
    renormalized distribution; (b) the emitted token is the greedy argmax over
    the grammar-masked candidates, which coincides with the argmax of the raw
    candidate slice. ``native_diagnostics`` exists to expose (a) live: it
    reports the raw top-k rows, the sliced raw mass, the mass outside the
    candidate set, and the argmax per question.

Natural noul surface forms:
    ``true``/``false`` are the JSON labels but not always the model's natural
    boolean answer tokens. For ``noul`` questions native mode ALSO binds the
    single-token surface forms ``yes``/``no`` (with and without a leading
    space) to the ``true``/``false`` labels, so a model that prefers ``Yes`` /
    ``No`` still contributes its probability mass to the right label. The
    grammar accepts them, the sliced weights SUM per label, and the ``Decision``
    probability keys stay ``"true"``/``"false"``. The cue echoes the declared
    labels only; yes/no are read as insurance against vocabulary mismatch.
    One consequence is pinned deliberately: ``Decision.value`` is the argmax of
    the SUMMED label distribution, so when a label's surface forms split the
    raw mass (e.g. ``false`` 0.15 versus ``true`` 0.10 + ``yes`` 0.10), the
    emitted token can map to a different label than the reported value.
    ``native_diagnostics`` exposes ``emitted_matches_argmax`` for exactly that
    audit; a real capture with the question's own cue in context should keep
    the two aligned.

Tokenizer seam:
    ``tokenize_fn: Callable[[str], Sequence[int] | None]`` is injectable on
    this runner and forwarded by ``runner.run_typed_decisions`` in native mode
    only. ``None`` (or an exception) from a call means "this text could not be
    tokenized" and fails the affected question closed. When not injected,
    ``_resolve_tokenize_fn`` derives the role's backend base URL from the
    primitives object and POSTs to ``{base_url}/tokenize`` via httpx (client
    pattern: ``src/backends/llama_server.py``).
    ``src/llm_primitives/tokenizer.py::LlamaTokenizer`` is deliberately NOT
    reused as the instrument: it returns counts only and silently falls back
    to a ``len(text) // 4`` heuristic on error, which cannot satisfy the
    exact-single-token-id contract (a heuristic count of 1 would fabricate
    eligibility). Its ``base_url`` is used as a last-resort resolution source.
    The same seam tokenizes each question's cue text; a cue that cannot be
    tokenized (or that tokenizes to nothing) fails that question closed.

Contract:
    * ONE call, ``len(native_questions)`` answer tokens plus the fixed cue
      tokens between them. ``n_tokens`` defaults to that exact total;
      temperature ``0.0`` and seed ``0``.
    * ``n_probs`` defaults to the largest per-question token-alternative count
      plus ``_N_PROBS_BUFFER``, capped at ``_MAX_N_PROBS`` (128 — the
      llama-server payload cap in ``src/backends/llama_server.py``). The
      buffer exists because the captured top-K is global (all tokens), not
      per-candidate.
    * At each ANSWER position the returned top-probability entries are matched
      to that question's candidate token ids (text fallback only for a whole
      row without ids), giving every declared candidate a weight (absent
      candidates weigh ``0.0``), then
      ``confidence.normalize_probabilities`` renormalizes. The argmax of the
      renormalized distribution is the ``Decision.value``;
      ``Decision.token_logprob`` is the raw model log-probability of that
      value's token (``None`` when the payload only carried linear probs).
      ``Decision.confidence`` uses ``choice_confidence`` for choice/noul and
      ``score_confidence`` for score, exactly like the JSON runner.
    * A position whose emitted token id/text is not one of the declared
      candidates, whose row is missing, or whose top-probability slice
      contains no declared candidate token yields a ``ParseFailure``
      (``native_unknown_candidate``) — never a default, and never a uniform
      fallback over an empty slice.
    * Questions that cannot be tokenized into single tokens — or whose
      candidates or cue cannot be tokenized — are NEVER forced into the
      native batch. Multi-token candidates are returned as
      ``ParseFailure(native_unsupported_candidates)``; an unresolvable or
      unresponsive tokenizer yields ``ParseFailure(native_tokenizer_unavailable)``
      for every affected question. Both are emitted alongside the native
      decisions so the caller can re-ask exactly those questions in JSON
      mode, which remains the correctness fallback. This module never falls
      back itself: a silent mode switch would make the receipt lie about how
      the answer was produced. With no resolvable tokenizer NOTHING is sent
      to the model — no tokenizer, no call, no guess.
    * Transport failures (``llm_call`` returning an ``"[ERROR: ...]"`` string)
      short-circuit to a single ``transport_error`` failure; the stale
      ``_last_inference_meta`` is deliberately NOT read on that path.

Layout side channel (for ``native_diagnostics``):
    Immediately before the call, ``run_typed_decisions_native`` attaches the
    exact per-position layout (question ids, candidate token bindings, cue
    lengths, answer row indices, the prompt, ``n_probs``) to the primitives
    object as ``_last_native_layout``. This is the same instance-level
    side-channel trade-off as ``_last_inference_meta`` and shares its
    concurrency caveat. ``native_diagnostics(result, primitives_snapshot)``
    accepts the primitives object (best), a mapping with
    ``{"native_layout": ..., "meta"/"completion_probabilities": ...}``, or a
    bare meta mapping (row-level output only — no question binding).

Row-shape note (production-consolidated-v9):
    ``/completion`` with ``n_probs`` set returns ``completion_probabilities``
    rows shaped ``{"id": int, "token": str, "bytes": [...], "logprob": float,
    "top_logprobs": [{"id", "token", "bytes", "logprob"}, ...]}``
    (``tools/server/server-task.cpp::probs_vector_to_json`` with
    ``post_sampling_probs=false``, the default). One row is captured per
    generated token, cues included; answer rows are addressed by their
    precomputed index. Older builds shipped the legacy
    ``{"content": str, "probs": [{"tok_str", "prob"}, ...]}`` shape and
    ``post_sampling_probs=true`` ships ``top_probs`` with linear ``prob`` and
    no ids; for a row without ``id`` the match falls back to the exact token
    text against the variant strings sent to ``/tokenize`` (see above).

Concurrency caveat:
    ``primitives._last_inference_meta`` and ``primitives._last_native_layout``
    are INSTANCE-level attributes, not request-scoped return values
    (``src/llm_primitives/inference.py``). This module reads them immediately
    after its single call, but a concurrent ``llm_call`` on the SAME
    primitives object can overwrite them. Native scoring therefore requires
    serialized use of one primitives object; sharing one across threads is
    unsupported.
