"""Tier-2 coherence judge as an orchestrator-hosted typed decision (2026-10-04).

The deterministic ``coherence_gate`` library (research repo, ``feat/coherence-gate-ec``)
compares a candidate kernel's outputs against the base kernel's. Tier 1 is
deterministic (exact match, ground truth, loop/salad detectors). Tier 2 is an injected
``judge_fn(item_pair) -> verdict`` called ONLY for outputs that diverged from base and
have no ground truth. This module is that judge: one typed decision answering

    "is the candidate output still a coherent, on-task answer to the prompt, as good
     as the base output?"

with exactly one of :data:`VERDICTS`.

Backends (operator direction, 2026-10-04; champion backend 2026-10-04, later the same day):

* ``auto`` (DEFAULT) — pick a backend per call and record the choice
  (``backend_selection`` on the verdict and in the call log):

  1. ``local:champion_sidecar`` with NATIVE scoring when the TD-29 champion sidecar is
     reachable AND serving the champion build (``/props`` ``build_info``);
  2. else the production role (``local``) with JSON scoring — the selection records why
     the sidecar was not used (down, loading, wrong build);
  3. else refuse (``not_ready`` when the orchestrator has no primitives;
     ``sidecar_unavailable`` when the caller pinned ``scoring="native"``, which production
     v10 cannot serve, see below).

* ``local:champion_sidecar`` — the CHAMPION llama-server build (SW-9 ``2b57340bf``; it
  becomes v11) running as the TD-29 side instance (default ``http://127.0.0.1:8199``,
  ``ORCHESTRATOR_COHERENCE_JUDGE_SIDECAR_URL``), scored with the typed decision plane's
  NATIVE arm over TD-29's code path (``coherence_judge_sidecar.py`` documents the launch
  recipe, the probe and the champion-identity rule). ``scoring="auto"`` means native
  there, with no JSON fallback: a champion that returns no probs is a defect to surface,
  not to paper over. When the sidecar is down the call is refused with 503
  ``sidecar_unavailable`` and the exact launch command in the message; this endpoint
  NEVER starts, stops or signals a process. The verdict records
  ``backend="local:champion_sidecar"``, ``build`` = the sidecar's ``build_info`` and
  ``scoring_mode="native"``.

* ``local`` — a production registry role served on this host (default
  ``worker_general``, ``ORCHESTRATOR_COHERENCE_JUDGE_ROLE``), scored with the NATIVE arm:
  one grammar-constrained token, the four labels re-keyed to single-token codes by TD-29
  (``native._bind_single_token_keys``), probabilities sliced from the server's
  post-sampling top-k. ``confidence`` is the normalized token probability of the chosen
  verdict. ``scoring="auto"`` re-asks in the JSON arm when the native readout is
  unavailable (``native_unsupported_candidates`` / ``native_tokenizer_unavailable`` /
  ``native_unknown_candidate`` — the last is what a production-v10 MTP/DFlash2 server
  returns, TD-1d.5: the v10 spec-accept path fills no probs); the fallback is recorded on
  the verdict and the JSON verdict carries no confidence. ``build`` is the production
  kernel-store build the role's server was launched from (stack launch sidecar
  ``binary_realpath``).

* ``cloud:<name>`` — a judge registered in ``orchestration/cloud_judges.yaml``
  (``cloud_judges.py``), for callers that ALREADY run on cloud models (AutoKernel's
  planner and critic). Structured output, no logprobs, so ``confidence`` is null.

WHEN v11 SHIPS (the champion promoted with SW-9 in production): the production roles
return token probabilities under speculative decoding, so ``auto`` must flip to the
production role (``local``) with NATIVE scoring and the champion sidecar becomes
unnecessary. The flip is: in ``CoherenceJudge._resolve_auto`` choose ``local`` with the
request's scoring (native first) instead of probing the sidecar, recalibrate
(``coherence_judge_calibration run --backend local --scoring native``; the new build
changes the judge key, so v10-era calibrations no longer validate), then retire the
``local:champion_sidecar`` backend and stop launching the sidecar.

Safety: a LOCAL call — ``local``, ``local:champion_sidecar`` and ``auto`` alike — is
refused (``measurement_window_held``) while the MI210 GPU window or the AutoKernel CPU
window is held (``src/runtime/measurement_windows.py``), before the sidecar is probed and
before anything is sent to a model: the sidecar burns CPU (or GPU) like any local server.
Cloud backends are exempt.

Calibration: every verdict carries ``calibration_id`` — the id of the latest PASSED
calibration record for this exact judge identity (judge version, prompt template hash,
backend, model, scoring mode, served model file, serving BUILD). A JSON-scored calibration
never validates native scoring, nor one backend or build another. With none, the judge REFUSES
(``judge_uncalibrated``) unless the caller passes ``allow_uncalibrated``; the refusal
is checked before inference when no candidate mode is calibrated, and again after it
for the mode actually used. Records are written by ``coherence_judge_calibration.py``.

Prefill (operator-endorsed addendum, 2026-10-04: prefill dominates native-mode cost):

* Prompt order = reuse order: the FIXED head (instructions + label definitions,
  ``_STATE_HEAD``), the caller's rubric, the original prompt, the base output, and the
  candidate output LAST. The base excerpt never depends on the candidate, so successive
  judgements of one base share the KV prefix through the reference. ``cache_prompt`` is
  true (explicit on the sidecar; llama-server's default on production roles).
* ``local:champion_sidecar`` pins one server slot (``id_slot``, default 0,
  ``ORCHESTRATOR_COHERENCE_JUDGE_SIDECAR_SLOT``): the judge is its only client. Production
  roles are never pinned (pinning hurts the unified pool's admission).
* Judged-length cap: ``max_judged_tokens`` per output (default
  :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_JUDGED_TOKENS`). Above it an output is judged as head + the span at
  tier 0's first-divergence byte offset (``divergence_offset``; computed when absent) +
  tail, and the verdict's ``excerpt`` says so (``excerpted``, char spans, token counts).
  Never silent.
* Every call logs ``serving`` (``prompt_ms``, ``prompt_n``, ``cache_n``,
  ``prefix_reuse_rate``, slot — the server's own numbers, null when unreported) and
  ``judged_tokens``; the calibration report rolls them up (``serving_rollup``).

Telemetry: local calls run inside ``primitives.request_context(request_id=<call_id>,
task_id="coherence_judge")`` so each one's ``serving_call.v1`` record
(``src/backends/serving_calls.py``) joins the judge-call log on ``call_id``; every
call, refusal included, appends one ``epyc.orchestrator.coherence_judge_call.v1``
line to the judge-call log (texts are hashed, never stored).

Belief kernel (DRAFT adapter row; the owning root session applies it to
``scripts/vidya/adapters/README.md`` and files the VB task):

    | Coherence-judge calibration records (``artifacts/coherence_judge/calibrations/*.json``,
    ``epyc.orchestrator.coherence_judge_calibration.v1``) and per-call verdicts
    (``logs/coherence_judge/calls.jsonl``, ``epyc.orchestrator.coherence_judge_call.v1``) |
    measurement (calibration) / verifier (per-call verdict) | **prospective — write side
    exists at first run (2026-10-04).** Calibration: project ``calibration_id``, ``judge_key``,
    set sha256 and n, pass/fail accuracy; protocol = the light 32-pair set, n=1 run, so the
    tuple grades as a sanity check, never a rate. Verdicts: a verifier, so project
    ``decided_proposition`` = "candidate output (sha) is a coherent, on-task answer to prompt
    (sha), equivalent to base output (sha), under judge ``judge_key``"; carry
    ``calibration_id`` (null = uncalibrated, never gate-eligible) and join to
    ``serving_call.v1`` on ``request_id == call_id``. | adapter: TBD |
