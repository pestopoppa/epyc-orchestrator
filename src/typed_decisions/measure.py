"""Measurement harnesses for the typed decision plane (TD-2 / TD-3).

Three offline-testable studies, each driving the same ``llm_call`` seam the
TD-1 runner drives and each writing a JSON receipt:

* ``run_contamination_study`` (TD-2) — asks one question catalogue under
  several deterministic question ORDERINGS and reports per-question answer
  flips against the canonical order. Rationale: intake-1486 measured a 24.7%
  cross-question contamination rate for a batched vendor call; the number
  that matters for this stack is OUR number, measured on OUR runner.
* ``run_calibration_study`` (TD-2) — compares the local confidence statistic
  from ``Decision`` against labeled outcomes: ECE, Brier and reliability
  bins. The ECE binning and metric are reused from
  ``src.llm_primitives.stat_tests``; this module does not reimplement that
  math. (Brier is deliberately not in ``stat_tests`` — each call site owns
  its one-line Brier — so the one-line mean squared error lives here.)
* ``run_fanout_study`` (TD-3) — measures the batching multiplier directly:
  a probe catalogue answered in one batched call per state vs one singleton
  call per question, reporting serial-summed and per-call wall times, token
  counts from ``_last_inference_meta`` where the primitives object exposes
  them, and answer agreement between the two arms. Rationale: TD-3 replaces
  a vendor's advertised batching multiplier with our own measurement.
  By default the catalogue is a content-neutral GENERATED probe (a transport
  measurement); pass ``questions=`` to ask a real catalogue under every
  state, which is what makes the agreement metric interpretable. The receipt
  records the choice as ``probe_source``. Live fixture:
  ``/mnt/raid0/llm/worktrees/intake-jev-sageattn-20260917/artifacts/typed_decisions/decision_set_v1/state.json``
  and ``.../questions.json`` (referenced, never copied).
* ``run_parallel_fanout_study`` (TD-3b) — the Jev-style parallel-sampler arm
  the sequential fan-out cannot express: the same per-(state, question)
  singleton calls as the sequential arm issued through a
  ``ThreadPoolExecutor(workers)``, against one cached prompt prefix. Arm C
  requires a ``primitives_factory`` (one instance per worker, all pointing
  at the same server) because ``LLMPrimitives`` carries instance-level,
  non-request-scoped state; without it the study refuses rather than racing
  a shared object. Reports pairwise agreement with the batched arm and
  wall-clock speedups over both existing arms.

Contract:

    * Every study fails loudly with ``MeasurementError`` when a live
      primitives object is unavailable or when a run yields no usable
      decisions. A receipt NEVER carries fabricated numbers.
    * Every study writes its receipt to the caller-supplied ``receipt_path``
      (default: ``<artifacts_dir or system tmp>/typed_decisions/
      <study>-<utc-stamp>.json``) and returns the receipt dict, which
      includes the resolved ``receipt_path``.
    * ``dry_run=True`` returns a plan without calling the model and without
      writing a receipt. This is the path behind the CLI ``--dry-run``.
    * Receipts carry ``timestamp``, ``mode``, ``role``, ``counts``,
      ``results`` and the ``prompt_sha256`` values of every
      ``DecisionResult`` produced (runner.prompt_sha256, i.e. the SHA-256 of
      the canonical first-attempt prompt).

The module is import-safe offline: no network or server object is touched at
import time. The CLI (``python -m src.typed_decisions.measure``) refuses to
make real calls unless ``--live`` is passed explicitly.

    Arm A (batched): one ``run_typed_decisions`` call per state answering the
    whole catalogue. Arm B (singleton): one call per (state, question) pair.

    ``questions`` selects the catalogue:

    * ``None`` (default) — the generated content-neutral probe: the study
      measures TRANSPORT/BATCHING overhead, not semantics, and its ids are
      stable for a given ``questions_per_state``. Agreement over such a probe
      is dominated by the model's position/batching sensitivity, not by the
      state, so read it as a stability statistic.
    * a provided catalogue — every state is asked that IDENTICAL catalogue
      (ids, text, options/levels and criteria verbatim). This is the
      interpretable mode: agreement answers whether batching changes the
      model's answer to a real question about a real state. The receipt
      records ``probe_source: "provided"`` (``"generated"`` on the default
      path). When ``questions`` is provided, ``questions_per_state`` may be
      omitted (it is derived from the catalogue) but if given must equal
      ``len(questions)``.

    ``/mnt/raid0/llm/worktrees/intake-jev-sageattn-20260917/artifacts/typed_decisions/decision_set_v1/questions.json``
    with the matching state fixture ``.../state.json``.

    Reports per arm: call count, wall time, serial sum of per-call
    ``DecisionResult.elapsed_ms``, the per-call list, and generated-token
    counts read from ``_last_inference_meta`` when the primitives object
    exposes them (``None``, not zero, when it does not). Agreement compares
    the resolved value of each (state, question) pair across arms with
    type-aware equality; pairs missing on either side are counted as
    unresolved, not as agreements.

    question) pair, issued one after another. Arm C (concurrent singleton):
    the SAME calls as Arm B, issued through ``ThreadPoolExecutor(workers)``,
    so per-question decoding runs in parallel over one cached prompt prefix.

    ``primitives_factory`` supplies Arm C's pool and is REQUIRED for any
    non-dry run: ``LLMPrimitives`` carries instance-level state
    (``_last_inference_meta`` and backend/slot bookkeeping) that is NOT
    request-scoped, so the study refuses with ``MeasurementError`` rather
    than racing one shared object across worker threads. The factory is
    called exactly ``workers`` times, once per pool slot; each call's
    inference meta is read back from the slot that issued it, so per-worker
    capture is correctly attributed. Every instance returned MUST point at
    the same model server — the measurement is concurrent requests against
    ONE cached prefix, not a cross-server comparison. A factory returning
    the same object twice is rejected (that is the shared-object race the
    factory exists to prevent). (A ``primitives_list`` parameter was the
    alternative; the factory won because it makes pool ownership and
    cardinality explicit instead of trusting the caller to size a list.)

    Determinism: all arms ask the states and the catalogue in the same order,
    and the runner's canonical prompt builder yields byte-identical prompts
    for the same (state, question) pair, which the receipt records by
    comparing Arm C's per-call ``prompt_sha256`` list with Arm B's.

    Per arm the receipt reports ``wall_ms``, ``serial_sum_ms``,
    ``tokens_generated`` and per-call latency; agreement is computed per
    (state, question) pair with type-aware equality against Arm A (and Arm C
    vs Arm B as a concurrency-noise check). Pairs missing on either side are
    counted as unresolved, never as agreements. ``metric_directions`` records
