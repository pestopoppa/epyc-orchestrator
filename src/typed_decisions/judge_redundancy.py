"""CJ-13/CJ-14: two-cheap-reader judge redundancy over a frozen rubric set.

The typed-decision plane answers a rubric directly (``noul`` per criterion,
one ``choice`` overall) in ONE JSON pass — this is the **typed judge**. A
plain single ``llm_call`` asks for the same per-criterion pass/fail list and
has its emission parsed and validated — this is the **LLM judge**. Both read
the SAME ~24 deterministic rubric cases, each a (answer text, criteria list)
pair whose per-criterion verdict is fully determined by the answer text and
frozen here as ground truth.

Why two readers: intake-1475 measured 91.5% pairwise agreement between two
cheap judges while explicitly NOT establishing who is right. This harness
keeps that distinction structural rather than rhetorical:

* **accuracy** is scored against the frozen per-criterion verdicts;
* **agreement** is scored between the readers and is reported separately,
  labelled ``agreement is not accuracy`` — two readers can agree perfectly
  and both be wrong (there is a test that exhibits exactly that);
* **human adjudication rate** is the fraction of criteria a two-reader
  redundancy policy would have to escalate to a human (readers disagree OR
  at least one reader failed to resolve). It is a projection from reader
  behaviour, not a measured human cost.

CJ-14 measurement discipline (intake-1490): the rubric set is frozen and
hashed (``rubric_set_sha256``), every case carries its own ``case_sha256`` in
the manifest, the dry-run plan pre-registers the per-case expected verdicts,
and a **blind prior** (one majority verdict per criterion, never reading an
answer) is reported as the lower bound any reader must beat.

Rubric construction
-------------------
Every criterion is a positively-phrased requirement, so "the criterion is
satisfied" is exactly ``expected[i] is True`` and the overall verdict is
``pass`` iff every criterion passes. Each criterion is decidable from the
answer text by one of: an exact phrase presence, an exact numeric value or
inclusive threshold, a countable count (sources, sentences, exclamation
marks), a lexical-format check (starts with ``Summary``, contains a bulleted
list), or a token-absence check. Families x 4 cases (24 cases, 72 criteria):

* ``refund_policy`` — exact values + token absence;
* ``evidence`` — distinct-source counts, including the exact-boundary case;
* ``format`` — sentence counts, exclamation marks, list/opening format,
  including the exact-three-sentence boundary;
* ``numeric_threshold`` — inclusive boundaries (100 ms, 90.0%);
* ``safety`` — required disclaimers and dosage-figure checks;
* ``citation`` — exact quote, named source, document identifier.

The mix: 8 all-passing cases, 4 all-failing cases, and 12 mixed cases whose
per-criterion ground truth splits at the exact boundaries above.

CLI::

    python -m src.typed_decisions.judge_redundancy --dry-run
    python -m src.typed_decisions.judge_redundancy --live --role frontdoor \\
        --server-url http://127.0.0.1:8199 --receipt <path>

``--dry-run`` makes no call and writes no receipt. Without ``--live`` (or
``--dry-run``) the CLI refuses (exit 2). A mock-mode primitives object is
refused; a receipt never carries fabricated numbers, and a run in which
NEITHER reader resolves a single criterion raises ``MeasurementError``. The
module is import-safe offline: no config, backend, or network object is
constructed at import time.
