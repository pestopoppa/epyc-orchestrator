    """Coerce a client-supplied role string to a canonical role name.

    ``role`` and ``force_role`` were bare ``str`` fields with no validation, so
    any client string flowed through the pipeline into the TASK_COMPLETED
    telemetry as ``producer_role``. A rescore of 117,074 historical completions
    (2026-07-21) found 157 rows with non-role values, including uppercase
    variants from 3-way seeding (``SELF``, ``WORKER``) and one row whose role
    field contained a prompt fragment ("Provide full Python snippet with
    variable name.").

    That is not cosmetic. ``compute_reward`` looks the role up in
    ``baseline_tps_by_role``; an unresolvable role misses every cost dimension
    and the task scores the full base reward. An unvalidated client string could
    therefore suppress the entire cost/speed penalty — a latent reward-hacking
    surface, and the same silent-miss shape as the ``role``/``producer_role``
    bug it was found alongside.

    Behaviour: resolve via ``Role.from_string`` (which already handles legacy
    aliases), accept a case-insensitive match, pass known non-role sentinels
    through untouched, and downgrade anything else to "" (auto-route) with a
    warning rather than letting it reach telemetry.
