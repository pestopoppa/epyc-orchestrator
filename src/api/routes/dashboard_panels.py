"""Single source of truth for dashboard panels and their data sources.

This registry is the anti-regression core of the dashboard freshness work. It
declares, in ONE place, every operator-facing panel, the endpoint that feeds
it, and the producer file(s) whose staleness determines whether the panel is
showing current data. Two consumers read it:

  * the panel endpoints (``dashboard.py``) stamp their payload with a
    ``_freshness`` envelope built from the panel's declared sources, and
  * ``/dashboard/api/health`` + ``tests/unit/test_dashboard_panels.py`` fold
    the whole registry to assert every declared panel is fresh and every
    displayed panel has a registered, monitored source.

Historically the "which files back which panel" knowledge lived implicitly and
separately inside each endpoint, so when a producer died the affected panel
froze silently and nobody had a list to check. Centralising it means a new
panel cannot ship without declaring (and thereby monitoring) its source.

**live vs file-backed.** A panel marked ``live=True`` is recomputed from
``/proc`` / live HTTP fan-out on every request (topology, region locks,
contention) — it is fresh by construction, and its only real staleness signal
is ``generated_at`` ageing on the *client* when the transport dies. Its backing
files (stack state, contention matrix) are declared ``optional`` so they inform
but never gate. A file-backed panel (inference tap, autopilot phase/progress,
journal) freezes when its producer dies; those sources GATE the panel class.

Import-safe: depends only on ``dashboard_tap`` (stdlib-only) and the standard
library, never on ``dashboard`` — so ``dashboard`` can import it without a
cycle. The path literals are re-derived here the same way ``dashboard.py``
derives them; ``test_dashboard_panels.py`` asserts they stay identical, so the
duplication cannot drift.

# tap:      structured events fire many/sec during generation; a single gen was
#           observed at ~138s, and there is setup between trials, so warn=90 /
#           stale=300 catches a DEAD producer without firing mid-generation.
# phase:    heartbeat refreshes on phase change + per eval-question; phase_status
#           uses DEFAULT_STALE_AFTER_S=900, so warn=300 / stale=900 aligns.
# state:    autopilot_state.json rewritten per trial; trials can be minutes.
# journal:  appended only on metric-bearing trials — legitimately sparse.
# log:      autopilot.log is chatty while alive.
# services/matrix: operator-curated / stack-change cadence — informational only.
