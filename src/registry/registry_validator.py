"""Registry consistency validator (added 2026-05-09).

Catches the failure modes that cost ~2 hours of debugging on 2026-05-09:

1. **Cross-section conflicts**: a role appears in both `server_mode.roles.X`
   and top-level `roles.X` with disagreeing values for fields the launcher
   reads from one section but the runtime reads from the other (e.g.
   `acceleration.type`). Edits to one path silently no-op.

2. **GGUF/port inconsistency**: two roles share the same `model.full_path`
   (= same llama-server should host them) but declare different `port:`
   values. This was the frontdoor + coder_escalation duplicate that wasted
   36 GB of mlocked weights and ran two competing OMP teams.

3. **YAML duplicate keys at the same path**: PyYAML silently keeps the LAST
   declaration. Detect and reject.

4. **`numa_ports` / `numa_instances` disagreeing with the declared NUMA
   topology** (added 2026-08-12, handoff P1-5). `server_mode.<role>.numa_ports`
   is the registry's copy of a fleet that `orchestration/stack_topology.yaml`
   (loaded as `scripts.server.stack_numa.NUMA_CONFIG`) owns. Two copies of one
   fleet is how months of NUMA drift went unnoticed: the registry-side copy is
   what `src/registry/model_descriptors.py`, `src/registry/stack_priors.py` and
   `scripts/autopilot/eval_tower.py` turn into backend URLs, so a stale copy
   points eval fan-out and capacity planning at ports nothing is listening on
   — silently, because every consumer just reads the list it was given.

   `scripts/server/stack_manifest.py:validate_declaration_parity()` already
   compares the two for roles the topology KNOWS (it iterates `NUMA_CONFIG`).
   It structurally cannot see the other direction: a registry role that
   declares a fleet the topology has never heard of is skipped by that loop
   entirely. That is the exact shape of the `vision_escalation` phantom fleet
   (ports 8187/8287/8387/8487, declared for a role with no `NUMA_CONFIG`
   entry). This check covers both directions on the file the launcher actually
   loads.

Wire-in (intended): orchestrator_stack.py:cmd_start calls `validate_all` on
the resolved registry path before any RegistryLoader instance, fails fast
on errors.

Wire-in (actual): `scripts/server/stack_commands.py:cmd_start` calls
`validate_or_raise(orchestration/model_registry.yaml)` — the COMPILED LEAN
registry, i.e. the artifact the orchestrator consumes — and returns 2 without
starting anything if it raises.
