"""Architect review and aggregation services.

Decision-plane core (H3: RD-1/3/5/6/8/9 + H1 TM-3). The heavyweight additions to
``ArchitectReviewService`` implement an explicit, typed, evidence-linked review
decision surface in SHADOW mode: it emits/records but never enforces. Enforcement
is gated by ``review_decision_enforce`` (blocked on H-LB LB-6) and is NOT wired
here. Model calls stay on the existing ``primitives.llm_call`` seam; every unit is
exercised with stub/fake completion callables (zero real inference).
