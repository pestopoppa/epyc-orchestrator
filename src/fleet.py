"""WP-12 server-fleet layer — one physical description per llama-server fleet.

Design: epyc-root handoffs/active/wp12-fleet-layer-design.md (operator-endorsed
2026-07-22). Governing contract: the operator-ratified fabric constitution
(heterogeneous-slot-fabric-residency.md banner) — fleet/role bindings are POLICY
DATA never code; one fact per physical resource, realized-probed; realized-first
truth over launch intent; fail-closed on anything unverifiable.

A ``ServerFleet`` is the single description of one physical llama-server
deployment, built from the registry ``server_mode`` source of truth (which fleet
exists, which roles ride it) plus generated stack priors (which ports are
realized) plus ``NUMA_CONFIG`` (topology idx / cpuset / placement policy per
port). A ``RoleBinding`` maps a logical role onto exactly one fleet; every
role-layer property (timeout, prompt, sampling, priority) stays looked up by
role name upstream of the physical backend.

The env/runtime-facts URL producers are deliberately NOT consulted here: fleet
identity comes from the registry + priors + NUMA_CONFIG only, which makes the
ESC-8 env-clobber class (``ORCHESTRATOR_STACK_NUMA_MODE=full`` wiring hot roles
to dead full ports) structurally impossible rather than a setdefault-ordering
accident (design §2.1).

Everything in this module is inert unless ``ORCHESTRATOR_FLEET_LAYER=1``
(default off). Flag-off, no production path imports it.

# Degraded-mode bootstrap (design §8 risk 1): when stack priors are absent
# (fresh clone, pre-launch API) the fleet layer keeps exactly ONE literal

# NUMA_CONFIG like any other endpoint set (full/quarter alignment included).

    2026-07-30. These were literal 5-port tuples per fleet, and they went stale

    halves — advertising 8280/8380/8282/8382/8385/8485, which no longer exist.
    That is not a cosmetic staleness: several dispatch paths fail OPEN on a port
    they cannot resolve to a topology index. ``backend.py`` falls back to a
    positional index, ``placement.py`` treats an empty region set as
    overlap-free, and ``cpu_region_lock`` yields NO LOCK AT ALL for an unknown
    ``(role, idx)``. A stale literal here is therefore a route to unlocked
    dispatch, not merely a wrong number.

    Deriving keeps the module's stated contract — the docstring already claimed
    ports "are resolved against NUMA_CONFIG like any other endpoint set" — and
    removes the second source of truth. If NUMA_CONFIG is unavailable (fresh
    clone, no scripts/ on the path) this yields an empty mapping, and the caller
    already handles that by skipping the fleet and leaving roles on the legacy
