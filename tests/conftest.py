"""Pytest configuration and fixtures for the orchestrator test suite.

Memory Safety:
    This file includes a memory guard that warns/exits if available RAM is below
    a safe threshold. This prevents crashes from running tests with pytest-xdist
    parallel workers that each load models.

    The 192-thread EPYC system with 1.13TB RAM can still crash if pytest spawns
    too many workers that each initialize the API (which loads the TaskEmbedder
    model). The lazy loading in src/api.py prevents this for mock mode tests,
    but this guard provides an additional safety net.

    The memory check is SKIPPED in CI environments (detected via CI or
    ORCHESTRATOR_MOCK_MODE env vars) since CI runners have limited RAM but
    only run mock-mode tests that don't load models.

Usage:
    pytest tests/              # Normal test run with memory check
    pytest tests/ -n 4         # Safe parallel execution (max 4 workers)
    pytest tests/ -n auto      # DANGEROUS on this machine - avoid

    - CLAUDE.md for memory constraints
    - research/ESCALATION_FLOW.md for memory pool architecture

    """Pin the runtime feature-flag file so the suite is REPRODUCIBLE.

    `src.features.runtime_flags_path()` reads
    `orchestration/runtime_flags.json` — a gitignored file the RUNNING API
    rewrites at will (`set_by: api:127.0.0.1`). So unit results depended on
    whatever the live orchestrator last toggled, and could change *mid-run*:
    during a 2026-08-02 attribution pass the `memrl` flag flipped while the
    suite was executing.

    The cost of that was not hypothetical. Comparing a clean-worktree baseline
    against the working tree produced 18 apparent regressions; 17 of them were
    this file, because the worktree never had the live flags. `structured_tool_
    output: true` alone rewrites tool returns into a `ToolOutput` wrapper and
    fails four `test_tool_registry` cases that pass with flags neutral. Any
    attribution done without this pin is measuring operator toggles, not code.

    Pinned to an EMPTY flag set, so every test sees each feature at its declared
    default rather than at whatever production happens to be running. A test
    that specifically exercises flag loading should monkeypatch
    `ORCHESTRATOR_RUNTIME_FLAGS_PATH` to its own fixture; that still works,
    because this only sets the ambient default.
