"""Hermetic seam for `tests/unit/`: keep unit tests off the shared host's
real inference lock and contention-gate state (TD-21).

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
A unit test that builds a real `LLMPrimitives` with MOCKED backends still
runs the real, unmocked `_real_call()` control flow (`src/llm_primitives/
inference.py`). That path always reaches two pieces of genuinely
process/host-wide state before it ever touches a backend:

1. The cross-role contention gate (`src.scheduling.contention_gate.get_gate()`),
   whose `_active_holders()` reads `src.runtime.cpu_region_lock.
   active_region_holders()` -- a scan of the HOST's real `/proc/locks` /
   region-lock files -- whenever `ORCHESTRATOR_PER_REGION_LOCKS` is truthy.
2. The host-wide `fcntl` inference lock (`src.inference_lock.inference_lock`,
   real module `src.runtime.inference_lock`), which by default resolves to
   `<ORCHESTRATOR_PATHS_TMP_DIR or {llm_root}/tmp>/heavy_model.lock` --
   i.e. `/mnt/raid0/llm/tmp/heavy_model.lock` on this shared host -- and
   blocks (default 180s timeout) on whatever REAL, concurrently-running
   session currently holds it.

On a shared host with other sessions actively serving inference, that means
a unit test can block for 60s+ on a lock/gate state that has nothing to do
with the code under test (observed cross-session flakiness).

WHY THIS IS SURGICAL, NOT A BLANKET ENV OVERRIDE
--------------------------------------------------
An earlier version of this fixture forced `ORCHESTRATOR_PATHS_TMP_DIR` and
`ORCHESTRATOR_PER_REGION_LOCKS` via `monkeypatch.setenv` + `reset_config()`.
That is the wrong seam: `PathsConfig` (`src/config/models.py`) is ONE
dataclass shared by everything -- `models_dir`, `cache_dir`,
`registry_path`, etc. -- so overriding the env global rippled into every
OTHER `get_config()` consumer active during the same test, not just the
lock. It broke tests with no relationship to the lock at all:
`tmp_path`-listing tests (this fixture's own scratch directory became an
extra, unexpected entry in `tmp_path.iterdir()`),
`test_config_consolidation.py::test_all_paths_on_raid` (asserts the REAL
default paths), `test_autokernel_enrollment.py` (compares a fresh
`get_config()`-derived recompute against values cached at collection time,
which the env change desynced), and any test that itself replaces
`src.config.get_config` with a plain (uncached) callable for its own
`monkeypatch` (this fixture's `reset_config()` teardown then called
`.cache_clear()` on a plain function and raised `AttributeError`).

This version instead monkeypatches ONLY the `get_config` NAME BINDING
inside `src.runtime.inference_lock`'s own module namespace (which
`src.inference_lock` is the exact same module object as -- see the TD-21
concurrent-import fix and its identity contract) to a wrapper that
delegates to the real, current `get_config()` for everything except
`paths.tmp_dir`. `from X import Y` binds an independent name in the
importing module; patching this one binding cannot reach any OTHER
module's own `get_config` import, so nothing outside the lock's own path
resolution is affected -- no env var, no shared lru_cache invalidation.

Equivalently, the contention gate singleton (`get_gate()`) is replaced with
one constructed with `active_holders_fn=lambda: {}` -- exactly the
existing, already-supported test seam `tests/unit/contention_gate_fixture.
py` uses for its own dedicated gate tests -- rather than forcing
`ORCHESTRATOR_PER_REGION_LOCKS`, so no test that itself inspects that env
var for an unrelated reason is affected either.

OPTING OUT
----------
A test that intentionally exercises the real lock/gate wiring -- e.g. to
prove the DEFAULT (unpatched) `get_config()`/env resolution behaviour, or
the `ORCHESTRATOR_PER_REGION_LOCKS=1` host-read branch itself -- marks
itself ``@pytest.mark.real_inference_lock_state`` to skip this fixture's
overrides entirely and control its own environment. As of TD-21, no
EXISTING test needs this: `tests/unit/test_inference_lock.py` and
`tests/unit/test_scheduling_contention_gate.py` (+ friends using
`tests/unit/contention_gate_fixture.py`) already fully control their own
`get_config`/`active_holders_fn` (applied after this fixture, via the same
function-scoped `monkeypatch`, so their more specific override wins); the
marker exists so a FUTURE test of the real default path has a documented
way to ask for it.
