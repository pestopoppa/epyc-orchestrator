"""Canonical cross-role contention matrix re-bench tool.

Phase F of `handoffs/active/cross-role-bw-aware-routing.md`. Replaces the
ad-hoc `/workspace/tmp/contention_matrix*.sh` scripts.

Reads NUMA_CONFIG to enumerate relevant role pairs, runs solo + parallel
HTTP benches against the live llama-server ports, writes a YAML matrix that
the gate (Phase A's `src/scheduling/contention.py`) consumes.

Smart-prune rule: once a pair is measured as catastrophic (ratio < 0.65),
do NOT include triples or larger N-way combinations that contain it — they'd
just re-confirm the catastrophic floor at high time cost. Skipped pairs are
recorded explicitly as `unknown_pairs` with `reason: skipped_due_to_pair_X`
so the gate's unknown-pair policy still applies.

Usage:
    # Re-bench the live stack (assumes stack is up + roles healthy)
    python scripts/server/contention_matrix.py

    # Subset — updates the measured rows and carries every unmeasured pair /
    # unknown-pair entry forward verbatim (never truncates the matrix), and is
    # stamped decision_grade=false because it is not a full re-measurement.
    python scripts/server/contention_matrix.py --roles frontdoor worker_general

    # Dry-run (show what would be measured, don't bench)
    python scripts/server/contention_matrix.py --dry-run

    # Validate the existing matrix without re-running
    python scripts/server/contention_matrix.py --validate-only

Output: writes `orchestration/contention_matrix.yaml` with full metadata
(topology hash, binary commit, host, measured_at). The gate uses the
topology hash to detect when NUMA_CONFIG has drifted from the measured state.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, and why the old arithmetic was worse than lossy.

    `par_time = max(par_a_el, par_b_el)` DISCARDS a failed leg: a timeout
    contributes 0.0, so max() silently returns the surviving leg's time. But
    `total_tokens` still counts BOTH legs, so tokens that were never generated
    get divided by one leg's elapsed time.

    THE ERROR IS ONE-DIRECTIONAL. Measured against the old arithmetic with
    5 s solo legs and DEFAULT_FLOOR = 0.85:

        both parallel legs 10 s (real 2x contention)   -> ratio 1.00, allow
        leg B TIMED OUT, leg A 10 s                    -> ratio 1.00, allow
        leg B TIMED OUT, leg A 5 s                     -> ratio 2.00, allow

    Note the middle row: when the failed leg is the one that WOULD have
    dominated max(), its timeout is not merely inflationary, it is INVISIBLE —
    the output is byte-identical to a healthy run. No input of this shape can
    produce a false `block`; every one of them reads as `allow`. So the
    arithmetic reports contention as most benign exactly when a server is
    collapsing under load, which is when it is least benign.

    A 2x48-thread overlapping pair on 48 physical cores is precisely the regime
    where the 180 s timeout bites, so the defect fires hardest on the
    measurement someone most wants to trust.

    The module already refuses to treat HTTP failures as throughput evidence
    for the pre-flight health check ("HTTP failures are not throughput
    evidence"); this applies the same rule to the bench legs themselves.

# <hostname>` and threw both away. A matrix measured at 14.1 d uptime therefore
# landed INDISTINGUISHABLE from one measured on a freshly rebooted host, and no
# later reader could tell which they were holding. That is what makes a reboot
# window worthless: the number it buys cannot prove the host was clean.
#
# The rule set is NOT re-implemented here. `host_health_warnings()` (uptime /
# kernel.numa_balancing / stray llama processes) and `cpu_freq_static_warnings()`

# establish host state emits `host_health_status: "unknown"` plus an explicit

#     solo. That stopped being true in the 2026-08-01 W1 cutover: the role is
