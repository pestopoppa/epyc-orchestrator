"""Stage-0 hardening for the GPU shadow lane (P2-3).

Three subcommands, all ZERO-INFERENCE and all safe to run against a live fleet:

  ``smoke``    Deterministic self-check of the lane's data plane. Runs entirely
               against the policy/tenancy tables and recorded FIXTURES — it does
               not contact the GPU, does not launch a server, does not send a
               request. Same inputs always produce the same verdict, so it can
               gate a commit rather than a bench window.

  ``attest``   Parse-and-judge the three attestation surfaces (health, host
               affinity, VRAM residency) from JSON on disk or stdin. The
               PARSING and the JUDGING are pure functions, so the same code that
               scores a fixture today scores live output at activation Step 5 —
               there is no second, unreviewed implementation waiting to be
               written under time pressure at 3am.

  ``recert``   Emit the COMPLETE contention recert set for the lane's host-side
               cores, and the exact ``contention_matrix.py`` command to run it.
               Plan-only: it prints the command, it never benches.

Why the recert set needed rebuilding (P2-4 finding P1-2): the lane's host slice
is the SMT siblings 184-191, whose physical cores are 88-95. A raw string
overlap of "184-191" against ``architect_general``'s "0-95" finds NOTHING, so
the single role that occupies all 96 physical cores was missing from the recert
set — the one role guaranteed to contend with the lane. Folding SMT siblings
onto physical cores first is what makes the set complete.
