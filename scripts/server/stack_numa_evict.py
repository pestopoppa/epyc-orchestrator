"""Pre-launch NUMA eviction and post-launch placement observation (INF-70/C7).

ENABLED 2026-09-03 (operator: "C7 — proceed") for every CPU llama-server role
in `orchestration/stack_topology.yaml` (`numa_pre_evict_gib: 40`); GPU
host-lane roles never declare it and are refused here even if they did.

WHY
---
`numactl --interleave=all` is a per-allocation POLICY HINT, not a guarantee.
When the round robin reaches a node with no free pages the kernel silently
falls back to a node that has some, rather than reclaiming on the intended one.
Page cache counts as "not free", so on a box that has been serving for hours
the striping quietly collapses — same argv, same prefix, no warning, no error,
nothing in the log.

Measured 2026-09-02 (INF-70): a 98 GB model loaded under the canonical prefix
landed 57.7 / 10.7 / 8.0 / 17.7 GB across nodes 0-3 (61% on node 0 against an
even 25%) and decode measured 7.65 t/s against 10.09 t/s with clean placement —
**-25%**, entirely remote-node traffic on a bandwidth-bound decode. The same
audit found a live `sd-server` skewed 8/40/32/19%.

`stack_prewarm` is a different lever and does not cover this: it populates the
PAGE CACHE interleaved so a later mlock finds pages already spread. This module
does the opposite — it FREES pages on every node so a fresh anonymous
allocation can be spread at all.

THE MECHANISM, AND THE FORCING FORM
-----------------------------------
Per node: allocate and TOUCH G GiB under `numactl --membind=<node>`. The hard
binding leaves the kernel no fallback, so it reclaims that node's page cache to
satisfy the fault; freeing the allocation then leaves the pages genuinely free
on that node.

G must be sized the FORCING way (D8x root cause, 2026-09-03): whenever
`free < TARGET`, G = TARGET + 2. The first helper used `TARGET - free`, which
fits inside the already-free pages, reclaims nothing, and leaves free exactly
where it was — that is why runs kept skewing "even after eviction". G strictly
larger than free makes reclaim unavoidable; after release the node holds
>= TARGET + 2 free. A node at or above target gets no allocation. Verify per
node; two passes, because concurrent page-cache growth can steal pass one.

`plan_allocation_gib` / `run_eviction` below are the same rule as
epyc-inference-research/scripts/utils/numa_evict.py. The research helper is
reused when the copy on disk IS the forcing form (probed by marker, not
assumed — the shared clone can lag origin/main); otherwise this module's own
forcing implementation runs. Either way the stack never runs the weak form.

GPU ROLES
---------
`gpu_host_lane: true` roles (architect_general, worker_vision) hold their
weights in VRAM and pin host threads to 184-191 == NPS4 node 3. There is
nothing to interleave and a 42 GiB forced reclaim on node 3 would only evict
the page cache the GPU co-tenant relies on. `pre_evict_gib_for_role` returns
0 for them regardless of what the YAML says, and a test pins that.
