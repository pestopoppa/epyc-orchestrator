#
# This is a DATA-ONLY coupling (handoffs/active/scoring-infra-standardization.md,
# 1c-fix (a)): the orchestrator never imports epyc-inference-research code across
# the repo boundary at runtime. Instead this file is a manual, verbatim copy, and
# `tests/unit/test_answer_scoring_drift.py` is the sync enforcement: it pins this
# file's own sha256 (so a hand-edit here fails loudly) AND replays a golden corpus
# — `tests/fixtures/answer_scoring_golden_corpus.json`, built from the canonical
# library's own regression suite (research `test_answer_scoring.py`) — through
# this copy, asserting every recorded verdict.
#
# VENDORING ONLY — NOT WIRED. No orchestrator consumer imports this module today.
# In particular `scripts/benchmark/debug_scorer.py:_extract_multiple_choice_letter`
# is a DIFFERENT, more permissive implementation (see its own cross-reference
# comment) and is NOT rewired onto this copy here — that unification is a gated
# SCORING CHANGE tracked separately at 1c-fix (c) (requires re-scoring affected
# sealed captures first, not a diff). Vendoring is additive only.
#
# To pick up an upstream change to the canonical library:
#   1. Diff research's scripts/benchmark/answer_scoring.py against the body below
#      (everything after this header block) and read what changed.
#   2. Replace the body below with the new file content, verbatim.
#   3. Recompute this file's sha256:
#        python3 -c "import hashlib;print(hashlib.sha256(open('scripts/benchmark/answer_scoring_vendored.py','rb').read()).hexdigest())"
#   4. Update EXPECTED_VENDORED_SHA256 in test_answer_scoring_drift.py, and the
#      `@<commit>` + source-file-sha256 above, to the new research commit/hash.
#   5. Re-run `pytest tests/unit/test_answer_scoring_drift.py`. If a corpus row's
#      verdict changed, that is a SCORING CHANGE to disclose (handoff row,
#      operator-visible), not a test to quietly update to match.

"""Canonical answer-extraction + objective-scoring primitives (single source of truth).

Promoted verbatim from v7_quality_gate_runner on 2026-07-24 so every scorer in the
stack shares ONE validated implementation instead of ~10 independent copies (each a
latent copy of the bare-letter / verbose-penalty bug). See
handoffs/active/scoring-infra-standardization.md. Regression tests: test_answer_scoring.py.

Module-level deps: re only. Fraction and sympy are imported lazily inside functions,
so importing this module is cheap and never requires sympy.

def extract_letter_answer(response: str) -> str:
    """Extract a single letter (A-J) from the model's response.

    ⚠ NOT interchangeable with `epyc-orchestrator`'s
    `scripts/benchmark/debug_scorer.py:_extract_multiple_choice_letter`, despite the
    obvious resemblance. Proven per-consumer 2026-08-11 (`mainC`, A10) rather than
    assumed, because that scorer is on the authority/sealed-capture path and a
    silent swap would RE-SCORE sealed evidence. The behavioural deltas:

      1. RANGE. This accepts A-J; debug_scorer accepts A-H. A reply of "I" or "J"
         parses here and returns None there.
      2. LAST-RESORT RULE — the big one, and it points in the PERMISSIVE direction.
         debug_scorer's Strategy 5 returns the LAST standalone letter
         unconditionally, so a verbose reply mentioning several letters always
         yields a guess. This function accepts a bare letter only when there is
         EXACTLY ONE candidate in the whole response, and otherwise returns "".
         So on the same corpus debug_scorer scores answers this function declines
         to parse — the divergence is systematic, not incidental.
      3. `\\boxed{...}` is honoured here (second priority) and not there at all.
      4. This accepts `ANSWER = X` as well as `is`/`:`; debug_scorer accepts only
         `is`/`:`.

    Migrating either onto the other is therefore a SCORING CHANGE, not a
    de-duplication, and is out of scope for the additive A10 pass. If it is ever
    done, it needs a re-score of the affected sealed captures, not just a diff.
