"""Deterministic scorer for debug benchmark suite.

Scores model outputs against ground-truth answers using methods from

# TD-21.11..21.14 / proposed era "EQ-1" (eval_quality; NOT YET RATIFIED —
# instrument_eras.yaml is human-only and this commit does not touch it).
#
# Flipping this to True changes live eval-quality numbers: a model-side
# parse failure at one of the four sites below (multiple_choice,
# f1_list, structural_exact_match, exact_match's last-resort fallback)
# currently scores `False` — WRONG, IN the quality denominator. With this
# flag True it instead raises `AnswerParseError`, which
# `seeding_scoring.score_answer_or_error` turns into an EXCLUDED
# `scoring_failed` row (OUT of the quality denominator) via the same path
# already used for an unreachable judge or a malformed gold
# (`artifacts/audits/td-json-consumer-audit-20260924.md` J-03/J-05/J-06/J-07).
#
# This is deliberately independent of E17-eval-task-failed-scores-zero-quality
# (ETR-1, `orchestration/instrument_eras.yaml`): E17 governs rows that already
# carry a structural `error` (an agent/config-caused `task_failed` row scores
# 0 but STAYS IN the denominator). A model-side parse failure carries no
# `error` at all today — nothing currently routes it through disposition
# classification — so this flag is a NEW boundary, not a re-application of
# E17's. It also runs the opposite direction from E17's own fix (which
# pulled a class of failure INTO the denominator to stop a broken config
# from shrinking its own denominator); before ratifying, confirm this
# doesn't reopen that same hole for a model that produces unparseable output
# instead of an error.
#
# ONE-LINE FLIP to ratify: set this to True (only after the EQ-1 row is
# added to `orchestration/instrument_eras.yaml` by the operator/human-only
# path — see the proposed row text in the TD-21.11..21.14 commit message).

# TD-21.9/21.10/21.15 (judge OUTPUT SHAPE; NOT YET RATIFIED — see the proposed
# "E19" era text in the ratification script). TD-21.32 (handoff): judge
# OUTPUT SHAPE (this flag) is orthogonal to judge BINDING (WHICH model —
# CJ-11, `canonical-judge-suite-revamp.md`, `src/llm.py:61-64`). This flag
# touches neither role resolution nor endpoint precedence — every site below
# still resolves the judge via the SAME existing seam
# (`scoring_config["judge_role"]` > `LLM_JUDGE_ROLE` env >
# `architect_general`, `_llm_judge_force_role`) and only constrains + parses
# whatever judge that seam already points at. Rebinding the judge later
# (CJ-11/CJ-13/CJ-14) changes nothing here.
#
# Flipping this to True changes THREE sites:
#
#   TD-21.9 (`_score_llm_judge`/`_parse_judge_boolean_verdict`, orchestrator
#   `/chat` branch): the wire is UNCHANGED — `output_schema={"type":
#   "boolean"}` was already sent unconditionally before this flag existed —
#   but the verdict is now parsed STRICTLY (exact `"true"`/`"false"` after
#   stripping) instead of `.lower().startswith("true")`, which is a
#   prefix-match artifact (e.g. a truncated `"tru"` or a judge that prefaces
#   its verdict with "truely not equivalent" both score `True` today). A
#   verdict that still isn't exactly `"true"`/`"false"` under this flag is a
#   SCORER-side failure and raises `ScoringUnavailableError` DIRECTLY — never
#   `AnswerParseError`. `AnswerParseError` (TD-21.11..21.14) is reserved for
#   the MODEL's own answer failing to fit its own required shape; here the
#   scoring INSTRUMENT (the judge) produced unusable output, the same class
#   of defect this module already raises `ScoringUnavailableError` for on an
#   unreachable judge or a malformed backend envelope a few lines below.
#   Already routes through `score_answer_or_error`'s EXCLUDED/
#   `scoring_failed` path with no further change — same as every other
#   `ScoringUnavailableError` in this module, and unconditional on
#   `EXCLUDE_UNPARSEABLE_ANSWERS` (that flag governs the DIFFERENT,
#   model-side `AnswerParseError` boundary only).
#
#   TD-21.10 (`request_llm_judge_text`, raw llama-server override branch):
#   this branch sends NO schema at all today (the defect the handoff names) —
#   flipping this flag sends the SAME `output_schema` as an OpenAI
#   `response_format` envelope on `/v1/chat/completions`, matching the
#   protocol this branch already speaks. Strict parsing then applies
#   identically to both branches.
#
#   TD-21.15 (`scripts/autopilot/eval_tower.py::_rubric_scores_for_answer`,
#   read via this SAME flag through `_load_orchestrator_debug_scorer()` so
#   ONE flag governs both files, never two copies to drift): sends
#   `rubric_scoring.RUBRIC_JUDGE_SCHEMA` as `output_schema` on the rubric
#   judge's `call_orchestrator_forced` turn; a reply the existing lenient
#   fisher (`_parse_rubric_judge_scores`) cannot parse at all then gets ONE
#   `parse_with_repair` extraction turn back to the SAME judge role before
#   that judge is dropped. The `deterministic_rubric_fallback`/
#   `rubric_source="heuristic_fallback"` path taken when EVERY configured
#   judge is still unparseable is UNCHANGED by this flag either way: it is
#   already clearly marked (`rubric_source`) and already counted per-arm by
#   the pre-existing SCORE-08 `rubric_source_counts` rollup, so converting it
#   to `scoring_failed` would be a second, larger denominator change riding
#   on a flag meant to fix judge-output PARSING, not judge-fallback policy.
#
# Judge-parse-outcome counters (`judge_parse_stats`, below) are ALWAYS on,
# independent of this flag — the observability this flag needs before
# ratification, mirroring `_PARSE_FAILURE_COUNTS`/EQ-1's own precedent.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-12, debugbench oracle rebuild — epyc-root
    ``artifacts/audit/debugbench-oracle-vacuity-20260812.md``). The suite's old
    oracle was a 100-character PREFIX of the reference solution scored with
    ``substring``. That prefix is class/constructor boilerplate already present in
    the buggy code the model is handed, so echoing the input scored a PASS on 4 of
    4 pool rows and on 76.1% of the upstream corpus. A longer prefix is not a fix:
    the defect is containment in the input, not length.

    This verifier asks the only question the shipped data can answer without
    executable tests — **what did the answer CHANGE?**

    * ``required_lines`` — lines the reference solution has and the buggy code
      does not. Matched as a substring of the candidate's whitespace-free text, so
      re-indenting or splitting a statement across lines still matches.
    * ``forbidden_lines`` — lines the buggy code has and the reference solution
      does not: the broken statements. Matched as a whole normalised LINE, never
      as a substring, because a buggy ``return idx;`` is a substring of a corrected
      ``return idx + 1;`` and substring matching there would fail correct answers.

    Both sides must hold in one candidate block. Anti-echo is structural, not
    incidental: reproducing the buggy code reproduces the forbidden lines and omits
    the required ones. The builder (``scripts/benchmark/debugbench_oracle.py``)
    additionally re-runs this function against the buggy code and against the
    reference solution at build time and refuses to emit a row unless it fails the
    first and passes the second, so neither a vacuous nor an unsatisfiable row can
    reach the pool.

    """Score using a local LLM as semantic equivalence judge.

    Used for semantic-oracle rows, including symbolic physics/math answers and
    long-form summary/reference-answer tasks where deterministic matching is
    insufficient.

    Calls an OpenAI-compatible endpoint to judge whether the model's answer is
    semantically equivalent to the expected answer.

    Endpoint resolution (realized-first, mirrors commits 5aa29f35/e97d4ed9):
    a hardcoded llama-server port (the old default 8082 = a worker_general
    *quarter* port) is dead on a quarters-only / eval-batch stack, so the judge
    now defaults to the ORCHESTRATOR API, which resolves the role to a LIVE
    backend itself. No new hardcoded llama port is introduced. An explicit
    ``judge_host``+``judge_port`` in ``scoring_config`` still wins (targeted
    override); otherwise the endpoint comes from ``ORCHESTRATOR_API_URL``
    (default ``http://localhost:8000``). A down/malformed judge remains an
    honest ScoringUnavailableError — we never launch anything and never
    silently fall back to substring.

    Protocol (two shapes — the earlier bug was speaking the wrong one):
        - Orchestrator API (the realized-first default / env path): the
          orchestrator does NOT serve a bare llama ``/completion``; its native
          eval ingress is ``POST /chat`` with an orchestrator payload
          (``real_mode``/``mock_mode``/``force_role``/``workload_class``) and a
          response carrying ``answer`` — NOT llama's ``choices[].message``.
          Posting the raw OpenAI/llama payload instead auto-routes the judge
          prompt through the frontdoor's multi-turn REPL loop (the ``/v1``
          OpenAI-compat ingress), which overruns the judge's short timeout and
          surfaces as a "malformed response" ScoringUnavailableError. We now
          POST ``/chat`` with ``force_mode="direct"`` (one direct LLM call, no
          REPL) and ``force_role`` pinned to a text role, and parse ``answer``
          — mirroring ``call_orchestrator_forced`` / eval_tower's rubric judge.
        - Explicit ``judge_url`` / ``judge_host``+``judge_port`` override: a
          direct llama-server target, so we keep the raw OpenAI-compatible
          ``/v1/chat/completions`` protocol and parse ``choices[].message``.

    Config:
        judge_host + judge_port: Explicit judge server (both required to
            override; targets ``http://{host}:{port}/v1/chat/completions``
            via the raw llama-server protocol).
        judge_url: Explicit full base URL override (wins over host/port; raw
            llama-server protocol).
        judge_role: Text role to pin the orchestrator judge to (force_role).
            Defaults to ``LLM_JUDGE_ROLE`` env, else the disjoint GPU
            ``architect_general`` lane.
        timeout: HTTP timeout in seconds (default: 30).

    Faithful to the reference deterministic scorer (epyc-inference-research

    Interpretation (derived from the suite's 402 rows — golds are JSON
    str / int / list / dict): "structural" equality means parse-then-
    canonicalize-then-compare, NOT string equality. Faithful to
    ``longcot_mini_adapter.score_structural``:
      1. Final-answer extraction: take the text after the LAST ``solution =``
         marker (the suite's final-answer anchor — the B7 last-occurrence
         convention; models echo the format instruction earlier, so the real
         answer is last). No marker ⇒ the model did not follow the required
         output format ⇒ a model-side parse failure (TD-21.13): ``False``

         routed through the ``AnswerParseError``/EXCLUDED path once that
         flag is ratified on. See ``_unparseable_answer``.
      2. Parse a leading JSON / Python-literal value (balanced-bracket scan for
         containers, quoted-string scan, scalar fallback — never raises).
      3. Recursively canonicalize BOTH sides: dict keys sorted; list order
         preserved; numeric scalars (incl. numeric strings — ``391365`` ==
         ``"391365"`` == ``391365.0``) collapsed to one form; non-numeric string
         case PRESERVED (SMILES / FEN are case-sensitive) with surrounding
         whitespace stripped and internal runs collapsed.
      4. Pure structural ``==``.

    The uniform ``scoring_config["extract_pattern"] = r"solution\s*=\s*(.+)"`` is
    a single-line hint; the structural parser here supersedes it because gold
    values span multiple lines (JSON arrays/objects) that a single-line ``.+``
    cannot capture.

    Fully deterministic: no sampling, no network, no model-in-the-loop —

    converted to the ``AnswerParseError``/exclusion path: unlike the other

    Deliberately NOT switched to the shared ``fish_json`` extractor

    no era boundary covering it (a 2026-09-24 main-session review caught
    this before it landed; see the TD-21.11..21.14 commit history). Stays
    the original naive ``find("{")``/``rfind("}")`` slice, which can
