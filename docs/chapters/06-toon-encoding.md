# Chapter 06: TOON Encoding

## Introduction

TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) is a compact JSON-compatible format that achieves **52.5% average token reduction** on structured data while maintaining lossless round-trip fidelity. Integrated into the orchestrator's REPL tools and prompt builders, it delivers **50.8% average TTFT improvement** — 10x the original 5% target. The improvement scales with model size: 8B models see 54.2% TTFT gains, and extrapolation to 235B+ architect models suggests 60-70%+.

TOON eliminates the redundancy inherent in JSON-serialized arrays of uniform objects — the dominant data shape in orchestration contexts (file listings, grep results, memory recall, procedure registries).

## Format Specification

TOON works by declaring field names once in a header row, then encoding each object as a simple CSV line. This trades JSON's per-object key repetition for a columnar layout that slashes token counts by 40-70% on typical orchestration payloads. The format also handles nulls implicitly and validates array bounds via a length declaration.

### JSON vs TOON

**JSON (147 tokens)**:

<details>
<summary>Code: JSON input example</summary>

```json
{
  "files": [
    {"name": "main.py", "type": "file", "size": 1234},
    {"name": "utils.py", "type": "file", "size": 567},
    {"name": "tests", "type": "dir", "size": null}
  ]
}
```

</details>

**TOON (~88 tokens, 40% reduction)**:

<summary>Code: TOON output example</summary>

```
files[3]{name,type,size}:
  main.py,file,1234
  utils.py,file,567
  tests,dir,
```

</details>

### Syntax Elements

| Feature | Syntax | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Length declaration | `[N]` | Validates array bounds |
| Field headers | `{field1,field2}` | Declared once, not per row |
| CSV rows | `val1,val2,val3` | Compact tabular data |
| YAML nesting | `key: value` | Non-uniform objects |
| Empty cells | trailing `,` | Implicit null |

### Why It Compresses

1. **Field names eliminated from rows** — declared once in the header instead of per-object
2. **Whitespace minimized** — CSV-style rows, no indentation
3. **Null values implicit** — empty cells instead of `"field": null`
4. **Structure preserved** — validators can check array bounds via `[N]`

</details>

## Implementation

The encoder lives in `src/services/toon_encoder.py` and exposes a small API: `encode()`, `decode()`, and a `should_use_toon()` heuristic that gates usage to arrays of 3+ uniform objects. There are specialized encoders for each orchestration data shape (file listings, escalation context, procedures, memory results), and the whole thing lazy-loads to avoid startup cost. If the underlying `toon_format` module is missing, every encoder silently falls back to JSON.

### Core API

**Source**: `src/services/toon_encoder.py`

<details>
<summary>Code: Public API surface</summary>

```python
# Check availability
is_available() -> bool

# Encode Python object to TOON (falls back to JSON if unavailable)
encode(data: Any, fallback_to_json: bool = True) -> str

# Decode TOON back to Python (lossless round-trip)
decode(toon_str: str) -> Any

# Heuristic: should this data use TOON?
should_use_toon(data: Any, min_array_size: int = 3) -> bool
```

</details>

### Specialized Encoders

Each encoder targets a specific orchestration data shape:

| Encoder | Input | Reduction | Integration |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `encode_list_dir()` | File listings | **64.6%** | `_list_dir()` REPL tool |
| `encode_escalation_context()` | Failure context | **46.2%** | Escalation chain |
| `encode_procedures()` | Procedure registry | **~55%** | `_list_procedures()` REPL tool |
| `encode_memory_results()` | Episodic recall | **~55%** | `_recall()` REPL tool |
| `encode_grep_hits()` | Grep results | **-18.6%** | Disabled (Markdown better) |

### Design Patterns

**Lazy loading**: The `toon_format` module loads only on first use, avoiding startup cost.

**Graceful fallback**: All encoders produce JSON when `toon_format` is unavailable. Zero API changes for callers.

**Heuristic gating**: `should_use_toon()` returns `True` only for arrays with 3+ uniform objects, preventing overhead on small or non-uniform data.

### Activated Escalation Encoding

`encode_escalation_context()` in `toon_encoder.py` is now wired into escalation paths (graph node escalation and multi-step failure chains). Escalation metadata -- failure context, role history, prior attempts -- compresses at ~55% token reduction via TOON's tabular encoding. Previously, escalation context was passed as raw JSON dicts. The integration point is the escalation node's context builder, which calls `encode_escalation_context()` before injecting context into the architect prompt.

### Grammar-Constrained Output Bypass

When `json_schema` or `grammar` is passed to `InferenceRequest`, the formalization post-processing step (TOON decode + re-encode cycle) can be skipped. Grammar-constrained outputs are already structurally valid -- running them through formalization is redundant work and risks mangling the constrained output. The bypass is automatic: if the request carries a schema/grammar field, the response pipeline short-circuits past the TOON formalization stage.

## Performance Results

The numbers tell a clear story: TOON cuts tokens by roughly half on typical orchestration data, and that translates directly into faster time-to-first-token. The gains are strongest on uniform, repetitive structures like file listings and architect error batches (60-70% reduction), and weakest on already-compact payloads like worker batches (26%). Bigger models benefit more because their per-token cost is higher.

### Token Reduction by Scenario

| Scenario | JSON Tokens | TOON Tokens | Reduction |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| File listing (20 files) | 229 | 73 | **68.1%** |
| Architect complex (20 errors) | — | — | **69.0%** |
| Procedure listing (10+) | — | — | **56.7%** |
| Memory results (10+) | — | — | **56.3%** |
| Grep results | 177 | 84 | **52.5%** |
| Escalation context | 91 | 49 | **46.2%** |

### TTFT Impact by Model Size

Multi-model validation across 5 orchestration scenarios:

| Scenario | Token Reduction | 0.5B TTFT | 8B TTFT |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| frontdoor_routing | 61.1% | +56.6% | +60.4% |
| coder_escalation | 51.9% | +46.4% | +49.5% |
| architect_complex | 69.0% | +58.7% | **+68.7%** |
| long_context_ingest | 54.4% | +48.2% | +56.5% |
| worker_batch | 25.9% | +27.4% | +35.9% |
| **Average** | **52.5%** | **47.5%** | **54.2%** |

TTFT improvement scales with model size — larger models benefit more from fewer input tokens because their per-token processing cost is higher.

### When TOON Excels vs Falls Short

| Excels | Falls Short |
|--------|-------------|
| Uniform arrays of objects | Deeply nested non-uniform structures |
| File listings, procedure lists | Highly variable schemas |
| Structured tool outputs | Semi-uniform data (<40% tabular) |
| Repeated field patterns | Single records or pure prose |
| Arrays with 3+ items | Grep results (Markdown is better) |

</details>

## Success Criteria

Every metric blew past the target. TTFT improvement landed at 50.8% against a 5% goal, token reduction hit 52.5% against a 30% target, and there was zero accuracy regression. The 51-test unit suite holds at 98% pass rate.

<summary>Target vs actual metrics</summary>

| Metric | Target | Kill Threshold | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------|--------|
| TTFT improvement | >5% | <2% | **50.8%** | 10x target |
| Token reduction | >30% | <15% | **52.5%** | 1.75x target |
| Accuracy regression | <1% | >3% | **0%** | No regression |
