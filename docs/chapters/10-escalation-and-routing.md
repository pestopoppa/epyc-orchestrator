# Chapter 10: Escalation, Failure Routing & Proactive Delegation

## Introduction

The orchestrator uses an **explicit pydantic-graph** to drive escalation decisions. Seven node classes encode valid transitions in Union return types. Rules from `escalation.py` are authoritative, and MemRL's learned escalation is advisory (injected via `TaskDeps`). Proactive delegation with complexity-aware routing (`proactive_delegation.py`) remains a separate execution strategy.

As of 2026-02-07, the legacy `FailureRouter` and `RoutingFacade` have been deleted. All escalation logic is now in `src/graph/nodes.py`.

## Unified Escalation Policy

The escalation policy is a single, rule-driven state machine that decides what happens after every failure. It categorizes errors, counts retries, and picks one of eight possible actions -- from simple retry all the way to terminal failure. The `THINK_HARDER` action is the interesting one: it tries to squeeze more out of the current model before paying the cost of tier escalation.

<details>
<summary>EscalationPolicy architecture and action types</summary>

### EscalationPolicy Architecture

<details>
<summary>Code: EscalationAction and ErrorCategory enums</summary>

```python
class EscalationAction(str, Enum):
    RETRY = "retry"          # Retry with same role
    THINK_HARDER = "think_harder"  # Same model, boosted config (CoT, 2x tokens)
    ESCALATE = "escalate"    # Escalate to next tier
    DELEGATE = "delegate"    # Route DOWN to a specific lower-tier role
    REVIEW = "review"        # Quality check by higher-tier model
    FAIL = "fail"            # Terminal failure
    SKIP = "skip"            # Skip the gate/step (optional gates only)
    EXPLORE = "explore"      # Fall back to REPL exploration (terminal roles)

class ErrorCategory(str, Enum):
    CODE = "code"              # Syntax/type errors, test failures
    LOGIC = "logic"            # Wrong output, failed assertions
    TIMEOUT = "timeout"        # Gate/execution timeout
    SCHEMA = "schema"          # IR/JSON schema violations
    FORMAT = "format"          # Style/format issues
    EARLY_ABORT = "early_abort"  # Model predicted failure, skip retries
    INFRASTRUCTURE = "infrastructure"  # Backend/network failure (seeding skips reward)
    UNKNOWN = "unknown"
```

</details>

**Early Abort**: When a model shows failure signs (incomplete generation, error patterns), immediately escalate instead of wasting retries. Detected via gate checks or output analysis.

### THINK_HARDER Action (February 2026)

Before escalating to a more expensive tier, the policy tries to squeeze more quality out of the current model. On the penultimate retry (`failure_count == max_retries - 1`), the decision is `THINK_HARDER` instead of `RETRY`. This returns the same role with a `config_override` that doubles the token budget, prepends a chain-of-thought prefix, and raises temperature slightly for diversity:

<details>
<summary>Code: THINK_HARDER config override</summary>

```python
EscalationDecision(
    action=EscalationAction.THINK_HARDER,
    target_role=context.current_role,   # Same model, not escalated
    config_override={
        "n_tokens": 4096,               # 2x default
        "cot_prefix": "Think step by step before answering.\n\n",
        "temperature": 0.5,             # Slightly higher for diversity
    },
)
```

</details>

The `config_override` field was added to `EscalationDecision` to carry these overrides. The calling node applies the overrides to the LLM call parameters for the retry turn.

**Rationale**: A model that failed once may succeed with explicit CoT prompting and more tokens to think. This is a "free" escalation axis -- often matching bigger-model quality without the cost or latency of tier escalation. Parallels Claude's extended thinking capability.

**Firing conditions**: Only fires for standard error categories (CODE, LOGIC, TIMEOUT on required gates, UNKNOWN). Format/schema errors and early-abort are excluded (they use retry-only or immediate-escalate paths respectively).

### Decision Rules

| Error Category | First Failure | Penultimate Retry | Final Retry | Post-Exhaustion |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| CODE, LOGIC | RETRY | THINK_HARDER | (exhausted) | ESCALATE |
| FORMAT, SCHEMA | RETRY | RETRY | FAIL | FAIL (never escalate) |
| TIMEOUT (optional gate) | SKIP | — | — | — |
| TIMEOUT (required gate) | RETRY | THINK_HARDER | (exhausted) | ESCALATE → FAIL |
| EARLY_ABORT | ESCALATE | — | — | — |
| INFRASTRUCTURE | — | — | — | Skip reward injection (seeding only); rules handle escalation |

<details>
<summary>Code: EscalationConfig defaults</summary>

```python
@dataclass
class EscalationConfig:
    max_retries: int = 2
    max_escalations: int = 2
    optional_gates: frozenset[str] = frozenset({
        "typecheck", "integration", "shellcheck"
    })
    no_escalate_categories: frozenset[ErrorCategory] = frozenset({
        ErrorCategory.FORMAT, ErrorCategory.SCHEMA
    })
```

</details>

**Rationale**: Format/schema errors indicate model instruction-following issues, not task complexity. Escalation won't help—just retry with clearer prompt.

### Budget-Based Termination (Fast-RLM)

Two budget controls are checked before `_execute_turn()` in all 7 node types, preventing wasted LLM calls when a task has consumed excessive resources:

| Budget | Default | Env Variable | Pressure Warning |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Worker call budget | 30 calls | `ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_CALL_BUDGET_CAP` | ≤3 remaining |
| Per-task token budget | 200K tokens | `ORCHESTRATOR_TASK_TOKEN_BUDGET_CAP` | <15% remaining |

When a budget is exceeded, `_rescue_from_last_output()` attempts graceful termination (extracting a partial answer from prior output) before falling through to hard FAIL. Feature flags: `worker_call_budget`, `task_token_budget`.

### EscalationContext Data Fields

`EscalationContext` now carries additional state for cross-tier continuity:

- `solution_file: str` — path to auto-persisted code from the previous role's REPL turns, so the escalation target can `peek()` and patch rather than rewrite from scratch
- `scratchpad_entries: list[ScratchpadEntry]` — model-extracted semantic insights (bug locations, eliminated approaches, discovered constraints) from the session scratchpad, injected as `## Previous Insights` in the escalation prompt

### Escalation Chains

<details>
<summary>Code: Role escalation map</summary>

```python
class Role(Enum):
    WORKER_GENERAL = "worker_general"
    CODER_ESCALATION = "coder_escalation"
    ARCHITECT_GENERAL = "architect_general"

    def escalates_to(self) -> Role | None:
        escalation_map = {
            Role.WORKER_GENERAL: Role.CODER_PRIMARY,
            Role.CODER_PRIMARY: Role.ARCHITECT_GENERAL,
            Role.ARCHITECT_GENERAL: None,  # Terminal
        }
        return escalation_map.get(self)
```

</details>

**Full Chains**:
- Worker → Coder → Architect (general tasks)
- Frontdoor → Coder → Architect (chat escalation)
- Ingest → Architect (long-context ingestion)
- Architect → FAIL (no further escalation)

</details>

## Pydantic-Graph Orchestration (February 2026)

The escalation loop is implemented as an explicit `pydantic_graph.Graph` with 7 node classes. Each node's `run()` method returns a Union of valid next nodes or `End[TaskResult]`, so transitions are type-safe and visible at a glance. MemRL components are injected as immutable `TaskDeps`, which means the learned escalation signals are actually wired up now -- they were dead code in the old `RoutingFacade` architecture.

<details>
<summary>Node classes and execution flow</summary>

### Node Classes

<details>
<summary>Code: All 7 graph node definitions</summary>

```python
from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, Graph, End, GraphRunContext

@dataclass
class FrontdoorNode(BaseNode[TaskState, TaskDeps, TaskResult]):
    async def run(self, ctx) -> FrontdoorNode | CoderEscalationNode | WorkerNode | End[TaskResult]: ...

@dataclass
class WorkerNode(BaseNode[TaskState, TaskDeps, TaskResult]):
    async def run(self, ctx) -> WorkerNode | CoderNode | End[TaskResult]: ...

@dataclass
class CoderNode(BaseNode[TaskState, TaskDeps, TaskResult]):
    async def run(self, ctx) -> CoderNode | ArchitectNode | End[TaskResult]: ...

@dataclass
class CoderEscalationNode(BaseNode[TaskState, TaskDeps, TaskResult]):
    async def run(self, ctx) -> CoderEscalationNode | ArchitectCodingNode | End[TaskResult]: ...

@dataclass
class IngestNode(BaseNode[TaskState, TaskDeps, TaskResult]):
    async def run(self, ctx) -> IngestNode | ArchitectNode | End[TaskResult]: ...

@dataclass
class ArchitectNode(BaseNode[TaskState, TaskDeps, TaskResult]):
    async def run(self, ctx) -> ArchitectNode | End[TaskResult]: ...  # Terminal

@dataclass
class ArchitectCodingNode(BaseNode[TaskState, TaskDeps, TaskResult]):
    async def run(self, ctx) -> ArchitectCodingNode | End[TaskResult]: ...  # Terminal

orchestration_graph = Graph(nodes=[all 7 classes])
```

</details>

### Node Execution Flow

Each node's `run()`:
1. Check `state.turns >= state.max_turns` → End(max turns)
2. Build prompt via `build_root_lm_prompt()` or use `state.escalation_prompt`
3. Call LLM via `deps.primitives.llm_call()` with role for this node
4. Extract code, auto-wrap FINAL, execute in REPL
5. If `is_final` → `End(TaskResult)`
6. If error → classify, record failure, decide retry/escalate/fail
7. If no error, no final → self-loop (return same node class)

### MemRL Integration via Dependencies

MemRL components are injected as immutable `TaskDeps`:

<details>
<summary>Code: TaskDeps dataclass and error handler</summary>

```python
@dataclass
class TaskDeps:
    primitives: LLMPrimitives | None
    repl: REPLEnvironment | None
    failure_graph: FailureGraphProtocol | None   # Anti-memory
    hypothesis_graph: HypothesisGraph | None      # Confidence tracking
    config: GraphConfig
    session_store: SessionStore | None

# Inside node error handler:
def _handle_error(ctx, error_cat, error):
    if ctx.deps.failure_graph:
        ctx.deps.failure_graph.record_failure(...)  # Anti-memory
    if ctx.deps.hypothesis_graph:
        ctx.deps.hypothesis_graph.add_evidence(...)  # Confidence
```

</details>

**Key change from RoutingFacade**: MemRL functions (`record_failure`, `record_mitigation`, `add_evidence`) are now actually called — they were dead code in the old architecture.

</details>

## 3-Way Confidence Routing (February 2026)

Instead of rigid mode-based routing, the frontdoor estimates P(success|action) for three approaches: handle it directly, handle it with tools, or escalate to an architect. Cost tiers are applied at routing time so Q-values stay faithful. Any role can now delegate downward, not just architects -- the old Tier C restriction is gone.

<details>
<summary>Routing approaches and confidence estimation</summary>

### Overview

The Unified Execution Model introduces 3-way confidence routing for faithful probability estimation. Instead of rigid mode-based routing, the frontdoor estimates P(success|action) for three approaches:

| Approach | Meaning | Maps To |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **SELF:direct** | Handle without tools | `frontdoor` with `mode=direct` |
| **SELF:repl** | Handle with tools, no delegation | `frontdoor` with `mode=repl`, `allow_delegation=False` |
| **ARCHITECT** | Escalate for complex reasoning | `architect_coding` or `architect_general` |
| **WORKER** | Delegate to faster workers | Scored via canonical `DelegationEvent` telemetry |

<details>
<summary>Code: Confidence estimation prompt</summary>

```python
def build_confidence_estimation_prompt(question: str, context: str = "") -> str:
    return f"""Estimate your probability of correctly answering this question.

Question: {question[:500]}...

Rate your confidence (0.0-1.0) for each approach:
- SELF: You handle it (no escalation or delegation)
- ARCHITECT: Escalate to architect for complex reasoning
- WORKER: Delegate to faster worker models

Output ONLY this format:
CONF|SELF:X.XX|ARCHITECT:X.XX|WORKER:X.XX"""
```

</details>

### Cost-Adjusted Routing

At production routing time, Q-values are adjusted by cost tier:

<details>
<summary>Code: Cost-adjusted route selection</summary>

```python
THREE_WAY_COST_TIER = {
    "SELF:direct": 2,   # Frontdoor speed
    "SELF:repl": 2,     # Frontdoor with tools
    "ARCHITECT": 4,     # Slow but capable
    "WORKER": 1,        # Fast workers
}

def route_with_cost(q_values: dict[str, float]) -> str:
    scores = {action: q / THREE_WAY_COST_TIER[action] for action, q in q_values.items()}
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)
```

</details>

**Key insight**: Cost is applied at routing time, not during Q-value updates. Q-values remain faithful P(success) estimates.

### General Delegation

Any role can now delegate (not just architects). Tier C restriction removed:

<details>
<summary>Code: Delegatable roles and allow_delegation parameter</summary>

```python
_DELEGATABLE_ROLES = frozenset({
    "worker_explore", "worker_math", "worker_general",
    "worker_summarize", "worker_vision",
    "coder_escalation",
})

# In _delegate():
if target_role not in _DELEGATABLE_ROLES:
    raise ValueError(f"Cannot delegate to {target_role}")
```

### allow_delegation Parameter

The `ChatRequest` model now supports `allow_delegation` override for testing:

```python
class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    allow_delegation: bool | None = Field(
        default=None,
        description="Override delegation. True=allow, False=disable, None=use feature flag.",
    )
```

Used by the 3-way evaluation script to test delegation value.

</details>

### Forced-role Semantics in 3-way Eval

For benchmark/seeding calls that set `force_role`, role identity is treated as an invariant for that call path:

- Quality-escalation role hopping is disabled under forced-role eval.
- Delegation is still allowed when `allow_delegation=True`.
- Result: eval keeps action identity stable (`SELF:*`, `ARCHITECT`) while still measuring delegation/tool value inside that action.

</details>

---

## Proactive Delegation

Proactive delegation is the alternative to reactive escalation. Instead of waiting for failures and escalating upward, the frontdoor classifies task complexity upfront and routes directly to the right tier. A heuristic classifier buckets tasks into four complexity levels, and architect review loops keep quality high for complex multi-specialist work.

<details>
<summary>Complexity classification and delegation paths</summary>

### Complexity Classification

<details>
<summary>Code: TaskComplexity classifier</summary>

```python
class TaskComplexity(Enum):
    TRIVIAL = "trivial"    # Frontdoor answers directly (factual, chat)
    SIMPLE = "simple"      # Frontdoor executes in REPL (single code task)
    MODERATE = "moderate"  # Frontdoor delegates to single specialist
    COMPLEX = "complex"    # Architect generates TaskIR, multi-specialist

def classify_task_complexity(objective: str) -> tuple[TaskComplexity, ComplexitySignals]:
    """Heuristic classifier based on objective text."""
    signals = ComplexitySignals()

    # TRIVIAL indicators
    if any(p in objective.lower() for p in ["what is", "who is", "define "]):
        return TaskComplexity.TRIVIAL, signals

    # CODE keywords
    if any(k in objective.lower() for k in ["implement", "code", "function"]):
        signals.has_code_keywords = True

    # MULTI-STEP keywords
    if any(k in objective.lower() for k in ["and then", "steps", "first"]):
        signals.has_multi_step_keywords = True

    # ARCHITECTURE keywords
    if any(k in objective.lower() for k in ["architecture", "design", "system"]):
        signals.has_architecture_keywords = True
        return TaskComplexity.COMPLEX, signals

    # Decision tree
    if signals.has_multi_step_keywords and signals.has_code_keywords:
        return TaskComplexity.MODERATE, signals
    elif signals.has_code_keywords:
        return TaskComplexity.SIMPLE, signals
    else:
        return TaskComplexity.SIMPLE, signals
```

</details>

**Escalation Triggers**: Override heuristics:

<details>
<summary>Code: Manual escalation triggers</summary>

```python
ARCHITECT_TRIGGERS = ["/architect", "/plan", "break this down"]
THINKING_TRIGGERS = ["/think", "ultrathink", "think carefully"]

if has_architect_trigger(objective):
    return TaskComplexity.COMPLEX  # Force architect
if has_thinking_trigger(objective):
    signals.thinking_requested = True  # Route to thinking_reasoning model
```

</details>

### Delegation Paths

| Complexity | Action | Target | Token Efficiency |
|------------|--------|--------|------------------|
| TRIVIAL | direct | frontdoor | Free (no delegation) |
| SIMPLE | repl | frontdoor + REPL | 100x (context local) |
| MODERATE | specialist | coder_escalation | Good (single model) |
| COMPLEX | architect | architect_general → TaskIR → multi-specialist | Lower (coordination overhead) |

**Design Goal**: Only invoke expensive architect (235B/480B models) when truly needed.

### Architect Review Loop

For COMPLEX tasks, the architect reviews specialist outputs:

<details>
<summary>Code: ArchitectReviewService and iteration limits</summary>

```python
class ArchitectReviewService:
    # Concise prompts - minimize architect output tokens
    REVIEW_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Review specialist output. Be BRIEF.

    Objective: {objective}
    Subtask: {action}
    Output (truncated): {output}

    Reply JSON only (no explanation):
    {{"d":"approve|changes|escalate|reject","s":0.0-1.0,"f":"<10 words","c":["fix1"]}}

    d=decision, s=score, f=feedback, c=changes (optional, max 3 items)"""

    MAX_REVIEW_TOKENS = 128  # Strict limit for expensive model
```

**Abbreviated JSON**: Uses single-letter keys (`d`, `s`, `f`, `c`) to reduce output tokens from architect. Review typically 30-50 tokens vs 100+ for verbose format.

### Iteration Limits

```python
@dataclass
class IterationContext:
    max_iterations: int = 3          # Per subtask
    max_total_iterations: int = 10   # All subtasks combined

    def can_iterate(self, subtask_id: str) -> bool:
        subtask_count = self.subtask_iterations.get(subtask_id, 0)
        return (
            subtask_count < self.max_iterations
            and self.total_iterations < self.max_total_iterations
        )
```

Prevents infinite review-fix cycles. After max iterations, accept output or escalate.

</details>

</details>

## Performance Comparison

Reactive escalation and proactive delegation solve the same problem from opposite ends. Reactive is cheaper and faster for well-defined tasks; proactive is better when you do not know what you are dealing with upfront.

<details>
<summary>Reactive vs proactive tradeoffs</summary>

### Reactive vs Proactive (Estimated)

| Metric | Reactive Escalation | Proactive Delegation |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Cold start | 0s (rules only) | Architect call (2-5s) |
| Task decomposition | Manual in code | Architect generates TaskIR |
| Specialist coordination | Sequential escalation | Parallel execution |
| Token usage | Lower (no upfront planning) | Higher (architect review) |
| Quality | Good for well-defined | Better for complex/novel |

**When to Use**:
- **Reactive**: Well-defined tasks, known failure patterns, speed-critical
- **Proactive**: Novel tasks, complex multi-file changes, quality-critical

</details>

## Model Fallback (February 2026)

Model fallback handles **infrastructure failure** -- when a backend is circuit-open, timed out, or OOM. This is distinct from task escalation which handles task complexity. Same-tier alternatives are tried laterally before failing the request, so a dead coder backend does not immediately escalate to architect.

<details>
<summary>Fallback map and failure classification</summary>

### Fallback vs Escalation

| Concern | Mechanism | Trigger | Direction |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Task complexity | Escalation (graph nodes) | Gate failure, retry exhaustion | Worker -> Coder -> Architect (upward) |
| Infrastructure failure | Fallback (`get_fallback_roles()`) | Circuit open, timeout, OOM | Same-tier alternatives (lateral) |

### Fallback Map

Defined in `src/roles.py` as `_FALLBACK_MAP`:

<details>
<summary>Code: Fallback role mapping</summary>

```python
_FALLBACK_MAP: dict[Role, list[Role]] = {
    Role.ARCHITECT_GENERAL: [Role.ARCHITECT_CODING, Role.CODER_PRIMARY],
    Role.ARCHITECT_CODING: [Role.ARCHITECT_GENERAL, Role.CODER_ESCALATION],
    Role.CODER_PRIMARY: [Role.CODER_ESCALATION],
    Role.CODER_ESCALATION: [Role.CODER_PRIMARY],
    Role.WORKER_MATH: [Role.WORKER_GENERAL],
    Role.INGEST_LONG_CONTEXT: [Role.ARCHITECT_GENERAL],
    Role.FRONTDOOR: [],            # Always-on, no fallback
    Role.WORKER_VISION: [],        # Hardware-specific, no fallback
}
```

</details>

### Failure Classification

`BackendHealthTracker.classify_failure()` maps error messages to `FailoverReason`:

| Error Pattern | FailoverReason |
|---------------|----------------|
| "circuit open" | `circuit_open` |
| "timed out", "timeout" | `timeout` |
| "out of memory", "oom", "kv cache" | `oom` |
| Everything else | `connection_error` |

### Integration

In `_real_call_impl()`: primary call via `_real_call_single()` catches `RuntimeError`. If `model_fallback` feature enabled, iterates `get_fallback_roles(role)` trying each alternative. Logs `FailoverReason` for observability.

Feature flag: `model_fallback`.

</details>

## Cache Affinity Phase 2.5 (February 2026)

The `TwoPhaseRetriever` gives a 15% score bonus to memories whose role matches the last-used role, biasing routing toward warm KV caches. On this hardware (DDR5-5600, 460 GB/s), a warm-cache hit saves 50-200ms of prompt eval depending on context length. The bonus is conservative but meaningful for consecutive same-role requests.

<details>
<summary>Cache affinity mechanism and lifecycle</summary>

### Mechanism

<details>
<summary>Code: Phase 2.5 cache affinity in TwoPhaseRetriever</summary>

```python
class TwoPhaseRetriever:
    CACHE_AFFINITY_BONUS: float = 0.15

    def __init__(self, ...):
        self._last_role_used: Optional[str] = None

    def _retrieve(self, embedding, ...):
        # Phase 1: Semantic filtering → candidates
        # Phase 2: Q-value × similarity → combined_score

        # Phase 2.5: Cache affinity bonus
        if self._last_role_used:
            for result in results:
                if result.memory.metadata.get("role") == self._last_role_used:
                    result.combined_score *= (1.0 + self.CACHE_AFFINITY_BONUS)
                    result.cache_affinity = self.CACHE_AFFINITY_BONUS

        # Phase 3: Sort by combined_score → top-n
```

</details>

### Lifecycle

`HybridRouter.route()` calls `retriever.update_last_role(role)` after every routing decision (both learned and rule-based paths). The next retrieval then applies the bonus. The `RetrievalResult` dataclass carries `cache_affinity: float` and appends a warning string when the bonus fires.

### Why This Matters

When the same role serves consecutive requests, the KV cache from the previous request is warm -- prompt evaluation drops to near-zero. A 15% bonus is conservative; on this hardware (DDR5-5600, 460 GB/s), a warm-cache hit saves 50-200ms of prompt eval depending on context length. This parallels Claude's prompt caching TTL economics: recently-used contexts are cheap to re-enter.

**Files**: `orchestration/repl_memory/retriever.py` (`TwoPhaseRetriever._retrieve`, `HybridRouter.route`)

</details>

## Approval Gates (February 2026)

Human approval gates halt the graph at escalation boundaries and destructive tool invocations. The graph serializes state via a resume token, waits for approval, then continues or rejects. By default, `AutoApproveCallback` auto-approves everything so existing behavior is preserved when the feature flag is off.

<details>
<summary>Halt triggers, protocol, and tier classification</summary>

### Halt Triggers

| Trigger | HaltReason | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Tier crossing | `ESCALATION` | Worker -> Coder, Worker -> Architect |
| Architect-tier model | `HIGH_COST` | Coder -> Architect (both Tier B, but expensive) |
| Destructive tool | `DESTRUCTIVE_TOOL` | `tool.destructive == True` |

### Protocol

```
Graph node -> should_halt(from_role, to_role)
  |
  +-- None -> continue normally
  +-- HaltReason -> build HaltState
       |
       +-- call deps.approval_callback.request_approval(halt)
            |
            +-- APPROVE -> continue to escalation/execution
            +-- REJECT -> End(success=False, answer="Rejected by user")
```

<details>
<summary>Code: Tier classification map</summary>

```python
_TIER_MAP = {
    "frontdoor": "A",
    "coder_escalation": "B",
    "architect_general": "B", "architect_coding": "B",
    "ingest_long_context": "B",
    "worker_general": "C", "worker_math": "C",
    "worker_explore": "C", "worker_summarize": "C",
    "worker_vision": "C",
}
```

</details>

Tier crossing (C->B, C->A) triggers `ESCALATION`. Same-tier to architect triggers `HIGH_COST`.

### Default Behavior

`AutoApproveCallback` auto-approves everything, preserving current behavior when `approval_gates=False` or no callback injected. The callback protocol (`ApprovalCallback`) can be implemented by API handlers for external approval flows.

Feature flag: `approval_gates` (requires `resume_tokens` + `side_effect_tracking`).

</details>

## Binding-Based Routing (February 2026)

Priority-ordered routing overrides let the same task type route to different roles depending on session state, user preference, or Q-values. Session bindings are cleared at conversation end, so they do not leak across interactions.

<details>
<summary>Priority levels and integration</summary>

### Priority Levels

<details>
<summary>Code: BindingPriority enum</summary>

```python
class BindingPriority(IntEnum):
    DEFAULT = 0        # model_registry.yaml task_type -> role
    CLASSIFIER = 10    # _classify_and_route() keyword heuristic
    Q_VALUE = 20       # MemRL Q-value suggestion
    USER_PREF = 30     # ChatRequest.preferred_role header
    SESSION = 40       # Session-specific override (during conversation)
```

</details>

### Integration

After `_classify_and_route()` returns a role, `binding_router.resolve(task_type)` is checked. If a binding with higher priority exists and its backend is available, that role is used instead. Session bindings are cleared at conversation end.

Implementation: `src/routing_bindings.py` (`BindingRouter`), integrated in `src/api/routes/chat_routing.py`.

Feature flag: `binding_routing`.

## Tool Requirement Detection (February 2026)

`detect_tool_requirement()` is a keyword-based heuristic that identifies prompts requiring tool invocation. When it fires, downstream execution stages can force REPL mode and inject a tool hint into the system prompt so the model knows which tool to reach for first.

<details>
<summary>Keyword map and RoutingResult integration</summary>

### Keyword Map

<details>
<summary>Code: Tool keyword mapping and RoutingResult fields</summary>

```python
_TOOL_REQUIRED_KEYWORDS = {
    "search for": "grep",
    "find in": "grep",
    "grep": "grep",
    "look up": "peek",
    "read the file": "peek",
    "list the files": "list_dir",
    "calculate": None,       # Needs tools but no specific hint
    "compute": None,
    "run the": "run_shell",
}
```

### RoutingResult Integration

```python
@dataclass
class RoutingResult:
    # ... existing fields ...
    tool_required: bool = False   # True when task needs tools
    tool_hint: str | None = None  # Specific tool name if deterministic (e.g., "grep")
```

</details>

When `tool_required=True`, execution stages can: (a) force REPL mode even if the heuristic would have selected direct, and (b) inject the `tool_hint` into the system prompt so the model knows which tool to invoke first.

**Files**: `src/api/routes/chat_routing.py` (`detect_tool_requirement`, `_TOOL_REQUIRED_KEYWORDS`), `src/api/routes/chat_utils.py` (`RoutingResult`)

## REPL Defensive Mechanisms (February 2026)

The REPL execution loops have three defensive mechanisms that prevent infinite loops, wasted tokens, and unnecessary escalation. These handle the surprisingly common cases where a model generates all-comment code, buries a valid answer inside a syntax error, or rambles for hundreds of tokens after producing its answer.

<details>
<summary>Comment-only guard, FINAL rescue, and early-stop streaming</summary>

### Comment-Only Guard

When the model generates Python code that is entirely comments (`# reasoning...`), the REPL executes it as valid Python — but produces no output, no error, no `FINAL()`. The turn loop continues indefinitely.

**Detection**: `_is_comment_only(code)` checks if all non-blank lines start with `#`.

**Response**: Returns explicit error to trigger `consecutive_failures` and eventually escalation: "Your output was all comments — no executable code ran."

Applied in all 4 REPL loops: `_execute_turn()` (graph), `_execute_react()` (ReAct), specialist delegation, and architect mini-REPL.

### FINAL() Rescue

When the model generates `FINAL("C")` inside code that has a syntax error before the FINAL line, the REPL crashes at the error and FINAL() never executes. The `_FINAL_RE` regex extracts the answer directly from the raw LLM output when REPL fails but FINAL() is present, preventing unnecessary escalation.

### Early-Stop Streaming

The model often writes `FINAL("D")` or `D|B` but continues generating hundreds of tokens of post-answer rambling. A three-layer `StopIteration`-based stream abort mechanism:

1. **`llama_server.py`**: `infer_stream_text()` catches `StopIteration` from `on_chunk` callback → breaks SSE loop
2. **`inference.py`**: When `_early_stop_check` is set on the primitives instance, creates composite callback that accumulates text and raises `StopIteration` when the check returns True
3. **Call sites**: Set `_early_stop_check` with appropriate regex before `llm_call()`, clear in `finally` block:
   - TOON regex for architect routing decisions (`D|[A-D]`, `D|.+`, `I|brief:`)
   - `_FINAL_RE` for REPL FINAL() detection in all 3 REPL loops

**Regex pitfall (fixed 2026-02-09)**: The original TOON regex used `D\|.{2,}` which required 2+ characters after `D|`. Single-character answers like `D|7` were missed because `.{2,}` needs 2+ chars and `.` doesn't match `\n`. Changed to `D\|.+` (1+ characters). Bare `D|` (partial streaming output) still correctly doesn't match.

### Architect Delegation Prompt Design

The architect investigate prompt must present `D|` and `I|` as **mutually exclusive alternatives**, not as a fill-in-the-blank template. MoE models (Qwen3-235B with expert reduction) are especially prone to echoing both formats when shown side by side.

<details>
<summary>Code: Correct vs incorrect prompt patterns</summary>

**Anti-pattern** (causes template echoing):
```
D|<your answer>
I|brief:<spec>|to:coder_escalation
```

**Correct pattern** (bullet-list alternatives):
```
- Direct answer: D|<answer>
- Delegate to specialist: I|brief:<spec>|to:<role>
```

</details>

Combined with explicit instruction: "Output ONE line only. Do NOT output both D| and I|."

The architect prompt frames the role as "software architect" whose job is to design solutions (approach, data structures, algorithm, edge cases) for a coding specialist to implement. This produces architecturally useful briefs rather than problem restatements.

</details>

## Escalation Reduction via Skill Propagation (February 2026)

SkillBank creates a knowledge pipeline that monotonically reduces escalation rates for recurring task categories. When an architect solves something a worker failed at, the approach gets distilled into a skill that workers can use next time. Novel tasks still escalate normally -- skills only help with patterns the system has seen before.

<details>
<summary>Skill propagation mechanism and THINK_HARDER interaction</summary>

### Pipeline

```
Architect solves task → trajectory stored in EpisodicStore
    → DistillationPipeline extracts escalation skill
    → SkillRetriever injects skill into worker prompts
    → Worker handles similar task directly (no escalation)
```

### Mechanism

When an architect solves a task that a worker failed, the distillation pipeline produces an `escalation` or `routing` skill encoding the architect's approach. On subsequent similar tasks:

1. `SkillRetriever` finds the skill via FAISS similarity
2. Skill principle is injected into the worker's prompt context
3. Worker applies the skill's guidance, potentially avoiding escalation

### Interaction with THINK_HARDER

Before escalating, the pipeline tries `THINK_HARDER` (same model, doubled token budget + CoT prefix). Skills complement this: the CoT prompt now includes relevant skill principles, improving the chance that THINK_HARDER succeeds and avoids escalation entirely.

### Expected Impact

For recurring task categories (e.g., specific debugging patterns, code generation patterns), escalation rate should decrease monotonically as skills accumulate. Novel tasks still escalate normally — skills only help with patterns seen before.

See [Chapter 15](15-skillbank-experience-distillation.md) for full SkillBank architecture.

## Vision Pipeline Routing (2026-02-09)

The vision pipeline has a critical routing requirement: VL models need multimodal payloads with base64-encoded images, but the standard text-only paths discard `image_path` from the request. Stage 7.5 intercepts vision-role requests with image data and routes them to the appropriate multimodal handler, falling through to text-only mode on exception.

<details>
<summary>Vision routing modes</summary>

| Mode | Handler | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `direct` | `_handle_vision_request()` | OCR preprocessing → multimodal chat completion → VL answer |
| `repl` | `_vision_react_mode_answer()` | Multimodal ReAct loop with OCR/calculate tools |

Falls through to text-only mode on exception (graceful degradation).

**File**: `src/api/routes/chat_pipeline/vision_stage.py`

</details>

## Try-Cheap-First Speculative Pre-Filter (February 2026)

Before the normal routing pipeline runs, a speculative pre-filter attempts the task with the cheapest HOT model (7B worker at 44 t/s). If the answer passes a quality gate, it comes back 2-3x faster. On failure, the request falls through to the normal pipeline completely unchanged -- the downstream escalation chain is untouched.

<details>
<summary>Pipeline position, configuration, and skip conditions</summary>

### Pipeline Position

```
Request → _route_request() → [Try-Cheap-First] → _execute_direct / _execute_repl / ...
                                    |
                                    +-- Pass quality gate → return ChatResponse (fast path)
                                    +-- Fail quality gate → fall through (normal pipeline)
```

The pre-filter inserts as Stage 7.9, BEFORE the existing execution stages. The downstream escalation chain (worker -> coder -> architect, `max_retries=3`, `max_escalations=2`) is completely untouched.

<details>
<summary>Config: Try-cheap-first settings</summary>

```python
# src/config.py — ChatConfig
try_cheap_first_enabled: bool = True
try_cheap_first_phase: str = "A"        # A=try all, B=Q-value guided, C=fully learned
try_cheap_first_role: str = "worker_explore"
try_cheap_first_max_tokens: int = 1024  # Keep short to minimize waste
try_cheap_first_quality_threshold: float = 0.6
try_cheap_first_q_threshold: float = 0.65  # Min Q-value for Phase B/C
```

</details>

### Skip Conditions

The pre-filter is bypassed when any of these hold:
- `force_mode` or `force_role` is set on the request
- The initial role is already a cheap worker (`worker_explore`, `worker_math`, `worker_vision`)
- Execution mode is `delegated`
- Phase B/C: MemRL Q-value for the cheap role is below `try_cheap_first_q_threshold`

### Quality Gate

The cheap answer must pass `try_cheap_first_quality_threshold` (default 0.6) via the existing `QScorer`. Answers that are too short, contain hedging, or fail structural checks are rejected and the normal pipeline handles the request.

**Files**: `src/api/routes/chat.py` (`_try_cheap_first`), `src/config.py` (`ChatConfig`)

</details>

## Early-Stop Timing Telemetry (2026-02-09)

When early-stop streaming aborts generation, the SSE `stop: true` event (which carries `timings`) is never reached, causing `generation_ms=0` for 79/99 REPL results. The fix computes timing from wall clock elapsed time in `infer_stream_text()` on early-stop break -- not pure generation time, but far better than 0 for TPS estimation.

**File**: `src/backends/llama_server.py` (early-stop branch in `infer_stream_text`)

## Conditional Schema Escalation (2026-02)

Schema failures now follow a conditional policy: retry while budget remains, allow escalation if the failure signature indicates a capability gap (schema/validation mismatch), and keep parser/transient formatting signatures as retry-only without escalation. This replaced the previous hard block on all schema escalation.

**Files**: `src/escalation.py`, `src/graph/helpers.py`

## Runtime Risk Gate and Prior/Posterior Blend (2026-02)

Routing now supports a strict runtime risk-gate contract in the hybrid router. When confidence falls below a calibrated threshold (base confidence plus conformal margin), the router abstains and escalates to a configured target role. Heuristics are integrated as probabilistic priors in posterior scoring rather than rules-only nudges, and THINK_HARDER uses an adaptive envelope that scales token budget and temperature by per-role expected ROI.

<details>
<summary>Risk gate mechanics and telemetry fields</summary>

### Risk Gate Contract

1. Compute effective threshold from calibrated/base confidence + conformal margin.
2. If enabled and confidence is below threshold, route uses `risk_abstain_escalate` to a configured abstain target role.
3. Emit risk provenance fields in telemetry:
   - `risk_gate_action`
   - `risk_gate_reason`
   - `risk_budget_id`

### Prior/Posterior Scoring

Heuristics are integrated as probabilistic priors in posterior scoring (instead of rules-only nudges):

- Posterior = learned selection score + prior term (`prior_strength`).
- Telemetry decomposition:
  - `prior_term_topk`
  - `posterior_score_topk`
  - `learned_evidence_topk`
  - `cost_term_topk`

### THINK_HARDER Adaptive Envelope

THINK_HARDER regulation now uses an adaptive envelope in graph helpers:

- token budget and temperature scale by per-role expected ROI
- cooldown and EMA marginal-utility gating reduce repeated low-yield expansions
- decision artifacts emit ROI/token/temperature diagnostics for analysis

</details>

## GraphRouter Cold-Start Routing (2026-02-20)

HybridRouter now supports an optional GNN-based parallel routing signal (`GraphRouterPredictor`) for cold-start optimization. When a new model joins the fleet with zero episodic memories, the GAT generalizes routing predictions from the model's capability embedding through shared query neighborhoods.

The blend is conservative: `posterior = (1-w) × retriever + w × graph_router`, where w anneals from 0.1 to 0.3 as the episodic store grows (500→2000 memories). TwoPhaseRetriever always dominates. Feature-gated: `ORCHESTRATOR_GRAPH_ROUTER=1` (requires `specialist_routing`).

See [Chapter 08: Graph-Based Reasoning](08-graph-reasoning.md) for schema, training, and onboarding details.

## Input-Side Routing Classifiers (2026-03)

Two regex-based classifiers run in `_route_request()` before model execution, providing input-side signals that complement the output-side conformal risk gate:

- **Factual Risk Scorer** (`src/classifiers/factual_risk.py`) — scores hallucination risk from prompt features. Mode: `shadow` (logs in `routing_meta`, no routing changes yet).
- **Difficulty Signal** (`src/classifiers/difficulty_signal.py`) — classifies prompt complexity into easy/medium/hard bands. Mode: `shadow`. When moved to `enforce`, modulates REPL token caps by band (easy=1500, medium=3500, hard=7000).

Both attach fields to `RoutingResult` (`factual_risk_score`, `factual_risk_band`, `difficulty_score`, `difficulty_band`) and are logged in every `ROUTING_DECISION` event via `routing_meta`. The output quality detector (`src/classifiers/quality_detector.py`) also gained think-block loop detection for reasoning model degeneration.

See [Chapter 16: Calibration and Risk Control](16-calibration-and-risk-control.md) for full classifier documentation, config, and relationship to the conformal risk gate.

## Literature Mapping (Architecture Review Alignment)

## Architect KV Cache Pre-warming (2026-02-19)

`EscalationPrewarmer` (`src/services/escalation_prewarmer.py`) speculatively prefills architect KV cache when `classify_task_complexity()` returns COMPLEX at turn 1. Sends `n_predict=0, cache_prompt=true` to warm the system prompt prefix (~500 tokens) before escalation actually happens.

**Validation**: Both architect servers (8083 general, 8084 coding) confirmed receiving pre-warm requests. Process-wide singleton via `get_shared_prewarmer()` with thread-safe hit/port telemetry.

**Bug found and fixed**: `_check_slot_available()` checked `s.get("state") == 0` but modern llama-server uses `is_processing` (boolean). Also assumed `/slots` returns a list, but single-slot servers (`-np 1`) return a dict. Fixed to `not s.get("is_processing", True)` with `isinstance(data, list)` guard.

**Risk**: Architect `-np 1` means pre-warming fills the only slot. Beneficial when escalation follows (shared prefix), wastes slot if no escalation. The `_check_slot_available()` guard prevents pre-warming a busy slot.

## LLMLingua-2 Escalation Compression — Not Viable (2026-02-19)

Evaluated LLMLingua-2 extractive compression for reducing architect escalation prompt size. **Result: not viable for code-heavy prompts**.

| Target Ratio | Actual Ratio | Latency | Code Preserved |
|-------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 0.3 | 0.14 | 12.9s | class/def/error: all destroyed |
| 0.5 | 0.23 | 2.7s | class/def/error: all destroyed |
| 0.7 | 0.30 | 2.5s | def preserved, class/error destroyed |

**Why it fails**: Over-compresses (0.5 target → 0.23 actual), `force_tokens` ineffective for code identifiers, compression latency (2.5-13s) exceeds ~1.67s architect prefill savings. Feature flag `escalation_compression` kept `False` permanently. Revisiting would require AST-preserving structural compression.

## Escalation Reduction via Skill Propagation

SkillBank creates a knowledge pipeline that monotonically reduces escalation rates for recurring task categories. The dynamic:

1. Hard task arrives → worker fails → **escalates to architect**
2. Architect solves → success trajectory stored in episodic store
3. Distillation pipeline extracts **escalation skill** (what reasoning strategy the architect used)
4. Skill injected into **worker prompts** on similar future tasks
5. Worker handles task directly → **escalation avoided**

<details>
<summary>Implementation details</summary>

### Escalation Skill Type

Escalation skills (`skill_type='escalation'`) capture transferable reasoning strategies:

```
Title:         "Debug Single-File Bugs Locally"
Principle:     For debugging tasks affecting a single file with a clear error message,
               use REPL mode with targeted stack-trace analysis. Escalation to coder is
               unnecessary for stack-trace-guided fixes.
When to apply: task_type is "debugging", context contains single file path and error trace
```

### Interaction with THINK_HARDER

`THINK_HARDER` and escalation skills are complementary:
- **THINK_HARDER** gives the current model more tokens/CoT to try harder on the same task
- **Escalation skills** give the model domain knowledge it wouldn't have otherwise

When both are active, the model first receives skill-augmented prompts (knowledge), and if it still fails, THINK_HARDER boosts its reasoning budget before escalation.

### Injection Points

Skills are prepended to the task prompt at two sites:
- `direct_stage.py` (line 78): Direct routing path
- `repl_executor.py` (line 294): REPL execution path

The `SkillAugmentedRouter` in `routing.py` retrieves relevant skills and passes the formatted context through `RoutingResult.skill_context`.

### Feature Gate

`ORCHESTRATOR_SKILLBANK=1` (requires `ORCHESTRATOR_MEMRL=1`). Currently feature-flagged OFF, awaiting initial distillation and A/B validation.
